<p><em>Enter ANTONIO, SALARINO, and SALANIO</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ANTONIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It wearies me; you say it wearies you;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What stuff ’tis made of, whereof it is born,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I am to learn;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That I have much ado to know myself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SALARINO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your mind is tossing on the ocean;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There, where your argosies with portly sail,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do overpeer the petty traffickers,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That curtsy to them, do them reverence,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As they fly by them with their woven wings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SALANIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The better part of my affections would</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And every object that might make me fear</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Would make me sad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SALARINO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My wind cooling my broth</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Would blow me to an ague, when I thought</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What harm a wind too great at sea might do.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But I should think of shallows and of flats,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And see my wealthy Andrew dock’d in sand,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To kiss her burial. Should I go to church</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And see the holy edifice of stone,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Which touching but my gentle vessel’s side,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Would scatter all her spices on the stream,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And, in a word, but even now worth this,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To think on this, and shall I lack the thought</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But tell not me; I know, Antonio</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Is sad to think upon his merchandise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ANTONIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Upon the fortune of this present year:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SALARINO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why, then you are in love.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ANTONIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fie, fie!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SALARINO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Because you are not merry: and ’twere as easy</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Some that will evermore peep through their eyes</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And other of such vinegar aspect</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That they’ll not show their teeth in way of smile,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter BASSANIO, LORENZO, and GRATIANO</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SALANIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We leave you now with better company.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SALARINO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would have stay’d till I had made you merry,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If worthier friends had not prevented me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ANTONIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your worth is very dear in my regard.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I take it, your own business calls on you</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And you embrace the occasion to depart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SALARINO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good morrow, my good lords.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BASSANIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SALARINO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ll make our leisures to attend on yours.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Exeunt Salarino and Salanio</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LORENZO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BASSANIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will not fail you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>GRATIANO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You look not well, Signior Antonio;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You have too much respect upon the world:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They lose it that do buy it with much care:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Believe me, you are marvellously changed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ANTONIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A stage where every man must play a part,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And mine a sad one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>GRATIANO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me play the fool:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And let my liver rather heat with wine</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio–</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I love thee, and it is my love that speaks–</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a sort of men whose visages</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And do a wilful stillness entertain,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With purpose to be dress’d in an opinion</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As who should say ’I am Sir Oracle,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!’</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>O my Antonio, I do know of these</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That therefore only are reputed wise</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ll tell thee more of this another time:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But fish not, with this melancholy bait,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ll end my exhortation after dinner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LORENZO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I must be one of these same dumb wise men,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For Gratiano never lets me speak.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>GRATIANO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, keep me company but two years moe,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ANTONIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Farewell: I’ll grow a talker for this gear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>GRATIANO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks, i’ faith, for silence is only commendable</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In a neat’s tongue dried and a maid not vendible.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZO</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ANTONIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is that any thing now?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BASSANIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>have them, they are not worth the search.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ANTONIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, tell me now what lady is the same</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That you to-day promised to tell me of?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BASSANIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>’Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How much I have disabled mine estate,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>By something showing a more swelling port</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Than my faint means would grant continuance:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nor do I now make moan to be abridged</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>From such a noble rate; but my chief care</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Is to come fairly off from the great debts</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Wherein my time something too prodigal</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I owe the most, in money and in love,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And from your love I have a warranty</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To unburden all my plots and purposes</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How to get clear of all the debts I owe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ANTONIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And if it stand, as you yourself still do,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Within the eye of honour, be assured,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My purse, my person, my extremest means,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lie all unlock’d to your occasions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BASSANIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I shot his fellow of the self-same flight</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The self-same way with more advised watch,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To find the other forth, and by adventuring both</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Because what follows is pure innocence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That which I owe is lost; but if you please</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To shoot another arrow that self way</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As I will watch the aim, or to find both</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Or bring your latter hazard back again</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And thankfully rest debtor for the first.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ANTONIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You know me well, and herein spend but time</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To wind about my love with circumstance;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And out of doubt you do me now more wrong</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In making question of my uttermost</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Than if you had made waste of all I have:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Then do but say to me what I should do</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That in your knowledge may by me be done,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BASSANIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Belmont is a lady richly left;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I did receive fair speechless messages:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To Cato’s daughter, Brutus’ Portia:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For the four winds blow in from every coast</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos’ strand,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And many Jasons come in quest of her.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>O my Antonio, had I but the means</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To hold a rival place with one of them,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I have a mind presages me such thrift,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That I should questionless be fortunate!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ANTONIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou know’st that all my fortunes are at sea;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Neither have I money nor commodity</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To raise a present sum: therefore go forth;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Try what my credit can in Venice do:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That shall be rack’d, even to the uttermost,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Go, presently inquire, and so will I,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Where money is, and I no question make</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To have it of my trust or for my sake.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>SCENE II: Belmont. A room in PORTIA’S house.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter PORTIA and NERISSA</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PORTIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>this great world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NERISSA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>with too much as they that starve with nothing. It</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>is no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>competency lives longer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PORTIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good sentences and well pronounced.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NERISSA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>They would be better, if well followed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PORTIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If to do were as easy as to know what were good to</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>do, chapels had been churches and poor men’s</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>cottages princes’ palaces. It is a good divine that</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>follows his own instructions: I can easier teach</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>o’er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>youth, to skip o’er the meshes of good counsel the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>choose me a husband. O me, the word ‘choose!’ I may</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NERISSA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at their</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>that he hath devised in these three chests of gold,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>silver and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>rightly but one who shall rightly love. But what</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>warmth is there in your affection towards any of</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>these princely suitors that are already come?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PORTIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I pray thee, over-name them; and as thou namest</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>them, I will describe them; and, according to my</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>description, level at my affection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NERISSA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, there is the Neapolitan prince.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PORTIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ay, that’s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>talk of his horse; and he makes it a great</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>appropriation to his own good parts, that he can</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>mother played false with a smith.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NERISSA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then there is the County Palatine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PORTIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He doth nothing but frown, as who should say ’If you</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>will not have me, choose:’ he hears merry tales and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>philosopher when he grows old, being so full of</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>married to a death’s-head with a bone in his mouth</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>than to either of these. God defend me from these</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>two!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NERISSA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PORTIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>he! why, he hath a horse better than the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Neapolitan’s, a better bad habit of frowning than</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man; if a</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>throstle sing, he falls straight a capering: he will</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, I</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>shall never requite him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NERISSA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young baron</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>of England?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PORTIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You know I say nothing to him, for he understands</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>nor Italian, and you will come into the court and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He is a proper man’s picture, but, alas, who can</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That this same paper brings you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BASSANIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O sweet Portia,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Here are a few of the unpleasant’st words</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When I did first impart my love to you,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I freely told you, all the wealth I had</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Rating myself at nothing, you shall see</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How much I was a braggart. When I told you</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My state was nothing, I should then have told you</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I have engaged myself to a dear friend,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The paper as the body of my friend,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And every word in it a gaping wound,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Have all his ventures fail’d? What, not one hit?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>From Lisbon, Barbary and India?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And not one vessel ’scape the dreadful touch</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of merchant-marring rocks?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SALERIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not one, my lord.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Besides, it should appear, that if he had</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The present money to discharge the Jew,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He would not take it. Never did I know</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A creature, that did bear the shape of man,</p>

<p>So keen and greedy to confound a man:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He plies the duke at morning and at night,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And doth impeach the freedom of the state,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If they deny him justice: twenty merchants,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The duke himself, and the magnificoes</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But none can drive him from the envious plea</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>JESSICA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I was with him I have heard him swear</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That he would rather have Antonio’s flesh</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Than twenty times the value of the sum</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That he did owe him: and I know, my lord,</p>

<p><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></p>

<p>Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the father</p>

<blockquote>
<p>are to be laid upon the children: therefore, I</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>promise ye, I fear you. I was always plain with</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>therefore be of good cheer, for truly I think you</p>

<blockquote>
<p>are damned. There is but one hope in it that can do</p>

<p>you any good; and that is but a kind of bastard</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>JESSICA</strong></p>

<p><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></p>

<p>Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you</p>

<p>not, that you are not the Jew’s daughter.</p>

<p>That were a kind of bastard hope, indeed: so the</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></p>

<p>Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and</p>

<p>another. This making Christians will raise the</p>

<p>It is much that the Moor should be more than reason:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>indeed more than I took her for.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LORENZO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How every fool can play upon the word! I think the</p>

<p>Not so, sir, neither; I know my duty.</p>

<p>That have of late so huddled on his back,</p>

<p>If you deny it, let the danger light</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What if my house be troubled with a rat</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To have it baned? What, are you answer’d yet?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Some men there are love not a gaping pig;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;</p>

<p>And others, when the bagpipe sings i’ the nose,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Cannot contain their urine: for affection,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:</p>

<p>As there is no firm reason to be render’d,</p>

<p>Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why he, a harmless necessary cat;</p>

<p>Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Must yield to such inevitable shame</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As to offend, himself being offended;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So can I give no reason, nor I will not,</p>

<p>More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing</p>

<p>I bear Antonio, that I follow thus</p>

<p>Why, this is like the mending of highways</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In summer, where the ways are fair enough:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PORTIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Speak not so grossly. You are all amazed:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is a letter; read it at your leisure;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It comes from Padua, from Bellario:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nerissa there her clerk: Lorenzo here</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Shall witness I set forth as soon as you</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And even but now return’d; I have not yet</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Enter’d my house. Antonio, you are welcome;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And I have better news in store for you</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There you shall find three of your argosies</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Are richly come to harbour suddenly:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You shall not know by what strange accident</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I chanced on this letter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ANTONIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am dumb.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BASSANIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Were you the doctor and I knew you not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>GRATIANO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NERISSA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Unless he live until he be a man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BASSANIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sweet doctor, you shall be my bed-fellow:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When I am absent, then lie with my wife.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ANTONIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For here I read for certain that my ships</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Are safely come to road.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PORTIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How now, Lorenzo!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NERISSA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ay, and I’ll give them him without a fee.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There do I give to you and Jessica,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>After his death, of all he dies possess’d of.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LORENZO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of starved people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PORTIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is almost morning,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And yet I am sure you are not satisfied</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of these events at full. Let us go in;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And charge us there upon inter’gatories,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And we will answer all things faithfully.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>GRATIANO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let it be so: the first inter’gatory</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether till the next night she had rather stay,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Or go to bed now, being two hours to day:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But were the day come, I should wish it dark,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That I were couching with the doctor’s clerk.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, while I live I’ll fear no other thing</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So sore as keeping safe Nerissa’s ring.</p>
