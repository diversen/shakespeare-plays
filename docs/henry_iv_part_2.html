<p><em>Warkworth. Before the castle</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter RUMOUR, painted full of tongues</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>RUMOUR</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Open your ears; for which of you will stop</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I, from the orient to the drooping west,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Making the wind my post-horse, still unfold</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The acts commenced on this ball of earth:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Upon my tongues continual slanders ride,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The which in every language I pronounce,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I speak of peace, while covert enmity</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Under the smile of safety wounds the world:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And who but Rumour, who but only I,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Make fearful musters and prepared defence,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whiles the big year, swoln with some other grief,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And no such matter? Rumour is a pipe</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And of so easy and so plain a stop</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The still-discordant wavering multitude,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Can play upon it. But what need I thus</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My well-known body to anatomize</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Among my household? Why is Rumour here?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I run before King Harry’s victory;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Quenching the flame of bold rebellion</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Even with the rebel’s blood. But what mean I</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To speak so true at first? my office is</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Under the wrath of noble Hotspur’s sword,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And that the king before the Douglas’ rage</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Stoop’d his anointed head as low as death.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This have I rumour’d through the peasant towns</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Between that royal field of Shrewsbury</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Where Hotspur’s father, old Northumberland,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lies crafty-sick: the posts come tiring on,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And not a man of them brings other news</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Than they have learn’d of me: from Rumour’s tongues</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They bring smooth comforts false, worse than</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>true wrongs.</p>

<p><em>Enter LORD BARDOLPH</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LORD BARDOLPH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who keeps the gate here, ho?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Porter opens the gate</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Where is the earl?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Porter</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What shall I say you are?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LORD BARDOLPH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tell thou the earl</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Porter</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>His lordship is walk’d forth into the orchard;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Please it your honour, knock but at the gate,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And he himself wilt answer.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter NORTHUMBERLAND</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LORD BARDOLPH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here comes the earl.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Exit Porter</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What news, Lord Bardolph? every minute now</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Should be the father of some stratagem:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The times are wild: contention, like a horse</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And bears down all before him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LORD BARDOLPH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Noble earl,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good, an God will!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LORD BARDOLPH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As good as heart can wish:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The king is almost wounded to the death;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And, in the fortune of my lord your son,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Kill’d by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And Harry Monmouth’s brawn, the hulk Sir John,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Is prisoner to your son: O, such a day,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So fought, so follow’d and so fairly won,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Came not till now to dignify the times,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since Caesar’s fortunes!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How is this derived?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Saw you the field? came you from Shrewsbury?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LORD BARDOLPH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A gentleman well bred and of good name,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That freely render’d me these news for true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here comes my servant Travers, whom I sent</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On Tuesday last to listen after news.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter TRAVERS</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LORD BARDOLPH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My lord, I over-rode him on the way;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And he is furnish’d with no certainties</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>More than he haply may retail from me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TRAVERS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn’d me back</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With joyful tidings; and, being better horsed,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That stopp’d by me to breathe his bloodied horse.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He ask’d the way to Chester; and of him</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I did demand what news from Shrewsbury:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He told me that rebellion had bad luck</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And that young Harry Percy’s spur was cold.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With that, he gave his able horse the head,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And bending forward struck his armed heels</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Against the panting sides of his poor jade</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Up to the rowel-head, and starting so</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He seem’d in running to devour the way,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Staying no longer question.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ha! Again:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Said he young Harry Percy’s spur was cold?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of Hotspur Coldspur? that rebellion</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Had met ill luck?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LORD BARDOLPH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My lord, I’ll tell you what;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If my young lord your son have not the day,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Upon mine honour, for a silken point</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ll give my barony: never talk of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Give then such instances of loss?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LORD BARDOLPH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who, he?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He was some hilding fellow that had stolen</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The horse he rode on, and, upon my life,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Spoke at a venture. Look, here comes more news.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter MORTON</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yea, this man’s brow, like to a title-leaf,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Foretells the nature of a tragic volume:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hath left a witness’d usurpation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MORTON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To fright our party.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How doth my son and brother?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Drew Priam’s curtain in the dead of night,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And I my Percy’s death ere thou report’st it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This thou wouldst say, ’Your son did thus and thus;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your brother thus: so fought the noble Douglas:’</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But in the end, to stop my ear indeed,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ending with ‘Brother, son, and all are dead.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MORTON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Douglas is living, and your brother, yet;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But, for my lord your son–</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why, he is dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>See what a ready tongue suspicion hath!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He that but fears the thing he would not know</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hath by instinct knowledge from others’ eyes</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That what he fear’d is chanced. Yet speak, Morton;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Tell thou an earl his divination lies,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And I will take it as a sweet disgrace</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MORTON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are too great to be by me gainsaid:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet, for all this, say not that Percy’s dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I see a strange confession in thine eye:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou shakest thy head and hold’st it fear or sin</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The tongue offends not that reports his death:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Not he which says the dead is not alive.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hath but a losing office, and his tongue</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember’d tolling a departing friend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LORD BARDOLPH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MORTON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am sorry I should force you to believe</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That which I would to God I had not seen;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Rendering faint quittance, wearied and out-breathed,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To Harry Monmouth; whose swift wrath beat down</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The never-daunted Percy to the earth,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>From whence with life he never more sprung up.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Even to the dullest peasant in his camp,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Being bruited once, took fire and heat away</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>From the best temper’d courage in his troops;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For from his metal was his party steel’d;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Which once in him abated, all the rest</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Turn’d on themselves, like dull and heavy lead:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And as the thing that’s heavy in itself,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So did our men, heavy in Hotspur’s loss,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fly from the field. Then was the noble Worcester</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Too soon ta’en prisoner; and that furious Scot,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Had three times slain the appearance of the king,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>’Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of those that turn’d their backs, and in his flight,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Is that the king hath won, and hath sent out</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Under the conduct of young Lancaster</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For this I shall have time enough to mourn.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In poison there is physic; and these news,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Having been well, that would have made me sick,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Being sick, have in some measure made me well:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And as the wretch, whose fever-weaken’d joints,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Out of his keeper’s arms, even so my limbs,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Weaken’d with grief, being now enraged with grief,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Are thrice themselves. Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Must glove this hand: and hence, thou sickly quoif!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou art a guard too wanton for the head</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Which princes, flesh’d with conquest, aim to hit.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now bind my brows with iron; and approach</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The ragged’st hour that time and spite dare bring</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To frown upon the enraged Northumberland!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Let heaven kiss earth! now let not Nature’s hand</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep the wild flood confined! let order die!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And let this world no longer be a stage</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To feed contention in a lingering act;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But let one spirit of the first-born Cain</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Reign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On bloody courses, the rude scene may end,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And darkness be the burier of the dead!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TRAVERS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This strained passion doth you wrong, my lord.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LORD BARDOLPH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sweet earl, divorce not wisdom from your honour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MORTON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The lives of all your loving complices</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lean on your health; the which, if you give o’er</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To stormy passion, must perforce decay.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You cast the event of war, my noble lord,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And summ’d the account of chance, before you said</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Let us make head.’ It was your presurmise,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That, in the dole of blows, your son might drop:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You knew he walk’d o’er perils, on an edge,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>More likely to fall in than to get o’er;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You were advised his flesh was capable</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Would lift him where most trade of danger ranged:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet did you say ‘Go forth;’ and none of this,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Though strongly apprehended, could restrain</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The stiff-borne action: what hath then befallen,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>More than that being which was like to be?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LORD BARDOLPH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We all that are engaged to this loss</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That if we wrought our life ’twas ten to one;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And yet we ventured, for the gain proposed</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Choked the respect of likely peril fear’d;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And since we are o’erset, venture again.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Come, we will all put forth, body and goods.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MORTON</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>’Tis more than time: and, my most noble lord,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I hear for certain, and do speak the truth,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The gentle Archbishop of York is up</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With well-appointed powers: he is a man</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Who with a double surety binds his followers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My lord your son had only but the corpse,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For that same word, rebellion, did divide</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The action of their bodies from their souls;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And they did fight with queasiness, constrain’d,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As men drink potions, that their weapons only</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Seem’d on our side; but, for their spirits and souls,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This word, rebellion, it had froze them up,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As fish are in a pond. But now the bishop</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Turns insurrection to religion:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He’s followed both with body and with mind;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And doth enlarge his rising with the blood</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of fair King Richard, scraped from Pomfret stones;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And more and less do flock to follow him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I knew of this before; but, to speak truth,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This present grief had wiped it from my mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Go in with me; and counsel every man</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The aptest way for safety and revenge:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Get posts and letters, and make friends with speed:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Never so few, and never yet more need.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy</p>

<p><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></p>

<p>Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me: the</p>

<p>brain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not</p>

<blockquote>
<p>able to invent anything that tends to laughter, more</p>

<blockquote>
<p>than I invent or is invented on me: I am not only</p>

<p>witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other</p>

<p>men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that</p>

<p>hath overwhelmed all her litter but one. If the</p>
</blockquote>

<p>prince put thee into my service for any other reason</p>

<blockquote>
<p>than to set me off, why then I have no judgment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to be worn</p>

<p>neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>send you back again to your master, for a jewel,–</p>

<p>the juvenal, the prince your master, whose chin is</p>

<p>not yet fledged. I will sooner have a beard grow in</p>

<p>the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his</p>

<p>cheek; and yet he will not stick to say his face is</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a face-royal: God may finish it when he will, ’tis</p>

<blockquote>
<p>not a hair amiss yet: he may keep it still at a</p>

<p>face-royal, for a barber shall never earn sixpence</p>

<p>out of it; and yet he’ll be crowing as if he had</p>

<p>writ man ever since his father was a bachelor. He</p>

<p>may keep his own grace, but he’s almost out of mine,</p>

<p>the satin for my short cloak and my slops?</p>

<p>He said, sir, you should procure him better</p>

<p>and then stand upon security! The whoreson</p>

<p>smooth-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes, and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>bunches of keys at their girdles; and if a man is</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>through with them in honest taking up, then they</p>
</blockquote>

<p>must stand upon security. I had as lief they would</p>

<p>put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with</p>

<p>security. I looked a’ should have sent me two and</p>

<p>twenty yards of satin, as I am a true knight, and he</p>

<p><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></p>

<p>My good lord! God give your lordship good time of</p>

<blockquote>
<p>day. I am glad to see your lordship abroad: I heard</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>say your lordship was sick: I hope your lordship</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>goes abroad by advice. Your lordship, though not</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>clean past your youth, hath yet some smack of age in</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>you, some relish of the saltness of time; and I must</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverent care</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>of your health.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Chief-Justice Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition to</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Shrewsbury.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An’t please your lordship, I hear his majesty is</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>returned with some discomfort from Wales.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Chief-Justice I talk not of his majesty: you would not come when</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I sent for you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And I hear, moreover, his highness is fallen into</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>this same whoreson apoplexy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Chief-Justice Well, God mend him! I pray you, let me speak with</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This apoplexy is, as I take it, a kind of lethargy,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>an’t please your lordship; a kind of sleeping in the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>blood, a whoreson tingling.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Chief-Justice What tell you me of it? be it as it is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It hath its original from much grief, from study and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>perturbation of the brain: I have read the cause of</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>his effects in Galen: it is a kind of deafness.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Chief-Justice I think you are fallen into the disease; for you</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>hear not what I say to you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Very well, my lord, very well: rather, an’t please</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>you, it is the disease of not listening, the malady</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>of not marking, that I am troubled withal.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Chief-Justice To punish you by the heels would amend the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>attention of your ears; and I care not if I do</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>become your physician.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>your lordship may minister the potion of</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>imprisonment to me in respect of poverty; but how</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>should I be your patient to follow your</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>prescriptions, the wise may make some dram of a</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>scruple, or indeed a scruple itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Chief-Justice I sent for you, when there were matters against you</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>for your life, to come speak with me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I was then advised by my learned counsel in the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>laws of this land-service, I did not come.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Chief-Justice Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great infamy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He that buckles him in my belt cannot live in less.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Chief-Justice Your means are very slender, and your waste is great.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would it were otherwise; I would my means were</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>greater, and my waist slenderer.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Chief-Justice You have misled the youthful prince.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The young prince hath misled me: I am the fellow</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>with the great belly, and he my dog.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Chief-Justice Well, I am loath to gall a new-healed wound: your</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>day’s service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>over your night’s exploit on Gad’s-hill: you may</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>thank the unquiet time for your quiet o’er-posting</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>that action.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My lord?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Chief-Justice But since all is well, keep it so: wake not a</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>sleeping wolf.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Chief-Justice What! you are as a candle, the better part burnt</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A wassail candle, my lord, all tallow: if I did say</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>of wax, my growth would approve the truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Chief-Justice There is not a white hair on your face but should</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>have his effect of gravity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>His effect of gravy, gravy, gravy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Chief-Justice You follow the young prince up and down, like his</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ill angel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not so, my lord; your ill angel is light; but I hope</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>he that looks upon me will take me without weighing:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and yet, in some respects, I grant, I cannot go: I</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>cannot tell. Virtue is of so little regard in these</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>costermonger times that true valour is turned</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>bear-herd: pregnancy is made a tapster, and hath</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings: all the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>other gifts appertinent to man, as the malice of</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>this age shapes them, are not worth a gooseberry.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You that are old consider not the capacities of us</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>that are young; you do measure the heat of our</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>livers with the bitterness of your galls: and we</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>that are in the vaward of our youth, I must confess,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>are wags too.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Chief-Justice Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>that are written down old with all the characters of</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>age? Have you not a moist eye? a dry hand? a</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>yellow cheek? a white beard? a decreasing leg? an</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>increasing belly? is not your voice broken? your</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>wind short? your chin double? your wit single? and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>every part about you blasted with antiquity? and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>will you yet call yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My lord, I was born about three of the clock in the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>afternoon, with a white head and something a round</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>belly. For my voice, I have lost it with halloing</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and singing of anthems. To approve my youth</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>further, I will not: the truth is, I am only old in</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>judgment and understanding; and he that will caper</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>money, and have at him! For the box of the ear that</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the prince gave you, he gave it like a rude prince,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and you took it like a sensible lord. I have</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>chequed him for it, and the young lion repents;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>marry, not in ashes and sackcloth, but in new silk</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and old sack.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Chief-Justice Well, God send the prince a better companion!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>God send the companion a better prince! I cannot</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>rid my hands of him.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Chief-Justice Well, the king hath severed you and Prince Harry: I</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>hear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>against the Archbishop and the Earl of</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Northumberland.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yea; I thank your pretty sweet wit for it. But look</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>you pray, all you that kiss my lady Peace at home,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>that our armies join not in a hot day; for, by the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord, I take but two shirts out with me, and I mean</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>not to sweat extraordinarily: if it be a hot day,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and I brandish any thing but a bottle, I would I</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>might never spit white again. There is not a</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>dangerous action can peep out his head but I am</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>thrust upon it: well, I cannot last ever: but it</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>was alway yet the trick of our English nation, if</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>they have a good thing, to make it too common. If</p>

<p>ye will needs say I am an old man, you should give</p>

<p>And have the summary of all our griefs,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When time shall serve, to show in articles;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But this is mere digression from my purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Here come I from our princely general</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To know your griefs; to tell you from his grace</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mowbray, you overween to take it so;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This offer comes from mercy, not from fear:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For, lo! within a ken our army lies,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Upon mine honour, all too confident</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To give admittance to a thought of fear.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Our battle is more full of names than yours,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our men more perfect in the use of arms,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then reason will our heart should be as good</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All members of our cause, both here and hence,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That are insinew’d to this action,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And present execution of our wills</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To us and to our purposes confined,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We come within our awful banks again</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And knit our powers to the arm of peace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This will I show the general. Please you, lords,</p>

<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>And either end in peace, which God so frame!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Or to the place of difference call the swords</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Which must decide it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My lord, we will do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Exit WESTMORELAND</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MOWBRAY</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a thing within my bosom tells me</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That no conditions of our peace can stand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HASTINGS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fear you not that: if we can make our peace</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Upon such large terms and so absolute</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As our conditions shall consist upon,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MOWBRAY</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yea, but our valuation shall be such</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That every slight and false-derived cause,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Yea, every idle, nice and wanton reason</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Shall to the king taste of this action;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That, were our royal faiths martyrs in love,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We shall be winnow’d with so rough a wind</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And good from bad find no partition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, no, my lord. Note this; the king is weary</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of dainty and such picking grievances:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For he hath found to end one doubt by death</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Revives two greater in the heirs of life,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And therefore will he wipe his tables clean</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And keep no tell-tale to his memory</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That may repeat and history his loss</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To new remembrance; for full well he knows</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He cannot so precisely weed this land</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As his misdoubts present occasion:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>His foes are so enrooted with his friends</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That, plucking to unfix an enemy,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He doth unfasten so and shake a friend:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So that this land, like an offensive wife</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That hath enraged him on to offer strokes,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As he is striking, holds his infant up</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And hangs resolved correction in the arm</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That was uprear’d to execution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HASTINGS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Besides, the king hath wasted all his rods</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On late offenders, that he now doth lack</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The very instruments of chastisement:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So that his power, like to a fangless lion,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>May offer, but not hold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>’Tis very true:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And therefore be assured, my good lord marshal,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If we do now make our atonement well,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our peace will, like a broken limb united,</p>

<p>Grow stronger for the breaking.</p>

<p>There’s never none of these demure boys come to any</p>

<p>and making many fish-meals, that they fall into a</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>kind of male green-sickness; and then when they</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>marry, they get wenches: they are generally fools</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and cowards; which some of us should be too, but for</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>inflammation. A good sherris sack hath a two-fold</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>operation in it. It ascends me into the brain;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>vapours which environ it; makes it apprehensive,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>quick, forgetive, full of nimble fiery and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>delectable shapes, which, delivered o’er to the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>excellent wit. The second property of your</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>which, before cold and settled, left the liver</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and cowardice; but the sherris warms it and makes</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the heart, who, great and puffed up with this</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valour</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>nothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; and</p>

<p>I stay too long by thee, I weary thee.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before thy hour be ripe? O foolish youth!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thou seek’st the greatness that will o’erwhelm thee.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stay but a little; for my cloud of dignity</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Is held from falling with so weak a wind</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That it will quickly drop: my day is dim.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou hast stolen that which after some few hours</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Were thine without offence; and at my death</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou hast seal’d up my expectation:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thy life did manifest thou lovedst me not,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And thou wilt have me die assured of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou hidest a thousand daggers in thy thoughts,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To stab at half an hour of my life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What! canst thou not forbear me half an hour?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That thou art crowned, not that I am dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>And to the English court assemble now,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I had forestall’d this dear and deep rebuke</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The course of it so far. There is your crown;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And He that wears the crown immortally</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Long guard it yours! If I affect it more</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Than as your honour and as your renown,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me no more from this obedience rise,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Which my most inward true and duteous spirit</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Teacheth, this prostrate and exterior bending.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>God witness with me, when I here came in,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And found no course of breath within your majesty,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>O, let me in my present wildness die</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And never live to show the incredulous world</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The noble change that I have purposed!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And dead almost, my liege, to think you were,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I spake unto this crown as having sense,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And thus upbraided it: ’The care on thee depending</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hath fed upon the body of my father;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, thou best of gold art worst of gold:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Other, less fine in carat, is more precious,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Preserving life in medicine potable;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But thou, most fine, most honour’d: most renown’d,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hast eat thy bearer up.’ Thus, my most royal liege,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Accusing it, I put it on my head,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To try with it, as with an enemy</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That had before my face murder’d my father,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The quarrel of a true inheritor.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But if it did infect my blood with joy,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If any rebel or vain spirit of mine</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Did with the least affection of a welcome</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Give entertainment to the might of it,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Let God for ever keep it from my head</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And make me as the poorest vassal is</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That doth with awe and terror kneel to it!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O my son,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>God put it in thy mind to take it hence,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That thou mightst win the more thy father’s love,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Pleading so wisely in excuse of it!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Come hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And hear, I think, the very latest counsel</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That ever I shall breathe. God knows, my son,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>By what by-paths and indirect crook’d ways</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I met this crown; and I myself know well</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How troublesome it sat upon my head.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To thee it shall descend with bitter quiet,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Better opinion, better confirmation;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For all the soil of the achievement goes</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With me into the earth. It seem’d in me</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But as an honour snatch’d with boisterous hand,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And I had many living to upbraid</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My gain of it by their assistances;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Wounding supposed peace: all these bold fears</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou see’st with peril I have answered;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For all my reign hath been but as a scene</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Acting that argument: and now my death</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Changes the mode; for what in me was purchased,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So thou the garland wear’st successively.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet, though thou stand’st more sure than I could do,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Have but their stings and teeth newly ta’en out;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>By whose fell working I was first advanced</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And by whose power I well might lodge a fear</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To be again displaced: which to avoid,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I cut them off; and had a purpose now</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To lead out many to the Holy Land,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lest rest and lying still might make them look</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Be it thy course to busy giddy minds</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With foreign quarrels; that action, hence borne out,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>May waste the memory of the former days.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>More would I, but my lungs are wasted so</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That strength of speech is utterly denied me.</p>

<p>Whereon, as an offender to your father,</p>

<p>I gave bold way to my authority</p>

<p>And did commit you. If the deed were ill,</p>

<p>To have a son set your decrees at nought,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To pluck down justice from your awful bench,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To trip the course of law and blunt the sword</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That guards the peace and safety of your person;</p>

<p>And in your power soft silencing your son:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After this cold considerance, sentence me;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And, as you are a king, speak in your state</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What I have done that misbecame my place,</p>

<p>My person, or my liege’s sovereignty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Till you do live to see a son of mine</p>

<p>Offend you and obey you, as I did.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So shall I live to speak my father’s words:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>’Happy am I, that have a man so bold,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That dares do justice on my proper son;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And not less happy, having such a son,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That would deliver up his greatness so</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Into the hands of justice.’ You did commit me:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For which, I do commit into your hand</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The unstained sword that you have used to bear;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With this remembrance, that you use the same</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With the like bold, just and impartial spirit</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As you have done ’gainst me. There is my hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You shall be as a father to my youth:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And I will stoop and humble my intents</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To your well-practised wise directions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And, princes all, believe me, I beseech you;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My father is gone wild into his grave,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For in his tomb lie my affections;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And with his spirit sadly I survive,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To mock the expectation of the world,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To frustrate prophecies and to raze out</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down</p>

<p>As it were, to ride day and night; and not to</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>deliberate, not to remember, not to have patience</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>to shift me,–</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SHALLOW</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is best, certain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But to stand stained with travel, and sweating with</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>desire to see him; thinking of nothing else,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>putting all affairs else in oblivion, as if there</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>were nothing else to be done but to see him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PISTOL</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Tis ’semper idem,’ for ‘obsque hoc nihil est:’</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>’tis all in every part.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SHALLOW</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>’Tis so, indeed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PISTOL</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My knight, I will inflame thy noble liver,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And make thee rage.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thy Doll, and Helen of thy noble thoughts,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Is in base durance and contagious prison;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Haled thither</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>By most mechanical and dirty hand:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Rouse up revenge from ebon den with fell</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Alecto’s snake,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For Doll is in. Pistol speaks nought but truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will deliver her.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Shouts within, and the trumpets sound</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PISTOL</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There roar’d the sea, and trumpet-clangor sounds.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter KING HENRY V and his train, the Lord Chief- Justice among them</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>God save thy grace, King Hal! my royal Hal!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PISTOL</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The heavens thee guard and keep, most royal imp of fame!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>God save thee, my sweet boy!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My lord chief-justice, speak to that vain man.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Chief-Justice Have you your wits? know you what ’tis to speak?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My king! my Jove! I speak to thee, my heart!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know thee not, old man: fall to thy prayers;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How ill white hairs become a fool and jester!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I have long dream’d of such a kind of man,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So surfeit-swell’d, so old and so profane;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But, being awaked, I do despise my dream.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Make less thy body hence, and more thy grace;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Leave gormandizing; know the grave doth gape</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For thee thrice wider than for other men.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Reply not to me with a fool-born jest:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Presume not that I am the thing I was;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For God doth know, so shall the world perceive,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That I have turn’d away my former self;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So will I those that kept me company.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When thou dost hear I am as I have been,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Approach me, and thou shalt be as thou wast,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The tutor and the feeder of my riots:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Till then, I banish thee, on pain of death,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As I have done the rest of my misleaders,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Not to come near our person by ten mile.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For competence of life I will allow you,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That lack of means enforce you not to evil:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And, as we hear you do reform yourselves,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We will, according to your strengths and qualities,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Give you advancement. Be it your charge, my lord,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To see perform’d the tenor of our word. Set on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Exeunt KING HENRY V, &amp; c</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Master Shallow, I owe you a thousand pound.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SHALLOW</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yea, marry, Sir John; which I beseech you to let me</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>have home with me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That can hardly be, Master Shallow. Do not you</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>grieve at this; I shall be sent for in private to</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>him: look you, he must seem thus to the world:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>fear not your advancements; I will be the man yet</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>that shall make you great.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SHALLOW</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I cannot well perceive how, unless you should give</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>me your doublet and stuff me out with straw. I</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>beseech you, good Sir John, let me have five hundred</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>of my thousand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sir, I will be as good as my word: this that you</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>heard was but a colour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SHALLOW</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A colour that I fear you will die in, Sir John.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fear no colours: go with me to dinner: come,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lieutenant Pistol; come, Bardolph: I shall be sent</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>for soon at night.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Re-enter Prince John of LANCASTER, the Lord Chief-Justice; Officers with them</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Chief-Justice Go, carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet:</p>

<p>Take all his company along with him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My lord, my lord,–</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Chief-Justice I cannot now speak: I will hear you soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Take them away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PISTOL</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Si fortune me tormenta, spero contenta.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Exeunt all but PRINCE JOHN and the Lord Chief-Justice</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LANCASTER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I like this fair proceeding of the king’s:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He hath intent his wonted followers</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Shall all be very well provided for;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But all are banish’d till their conversations</p>

<p>Appear more wise and modest to the world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lord Chief-Justice And so they are.</p>

<p><strong>LANCASTER</strong></p>

<p>The king hath call’d his parliament, my lord.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I will lay odds that, ere this year expire,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We bear our civil swords and native fire</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As far as France: I beard a bird so sing,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whose music, to my thinking, pleased the king.</p>

<p>Come, will you hence?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>EPILOGUE</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Spoken by a Dancer</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>First my fear; then my courtesy; last my speech.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My fear is, your displeasure; my courtesy, my duty;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and my speech, to beg your pardons. If you look</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>for a good speech now, you undo me: for what I have</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>to say is of mine own making; and what indeed I</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>should say will, I doubt, prove mine own marring.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>known to you, as it is very well, I was lately here</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>in the end of a displeasing play, to pray your</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>patience for it and to promise you a better. I</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>meant indeed to pay you with this; which, if like an</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ill venture it come unluckily home, I break, and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>you, my gentle creditors, lose. Here I promised you</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I would be and here I commit my body to your</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>mercies: bate me some and I will pay you some and,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>as most debtors do, promise you infinitely.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>you command me to use my legs? and yet that were but</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>light payment, to dance out of your debt. But a</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>good conscience will make any possible satisfaction,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and so would I. All the gentlewomen here have</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>forgiven me: if the gentlemen will not, then the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen, which</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>was never seen before in such an assembly.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One word more, I beseech you. If you be not too</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>much cloyed with fat meat, our humble author will</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>continue the story, with Sir John in it, and make</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>you merry with fair Katharine of France: where, for</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>any thing I know, Falstaff shall die of a sweat,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>unless already a’ be killed with your hard</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>not the man. My tongue is weary; when my legs are</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>too, I will bid you good night: and so kneel down</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>before you; but, indeed, to pray for the queen.</p>
