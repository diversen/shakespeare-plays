<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in black</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>COUNTESS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BERTRAM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And I in going, madam, weep o’er my father’s death</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>anew: but I must attend his majesty’s command, to</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LAFEU</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>than lack it where there is such abundance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>COUNTESS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What hope is there of his majesty’s amendment?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LAFEU</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>finds no other advantage in the process but only the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>losing of hope by time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>COUNTESS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This young gentlewoman had a father,–O, that</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>‘had’! how sad a passage ’tis!–whose skill was</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>far, would have made nature immortal, and death</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>should have play for lack of work. Would, for the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>king’s sake, he were living! I think it would be</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the death of the king’s disease.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LAFEU</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How called you the man you speak of, madam?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>COUNTESS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LAFEU</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>could be set up against mortality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BERTRAM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LAFEU</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A fistula, my lord.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BERTRAM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I heard not of it before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LAFEU</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>COUNTESS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>her education promises; her dispositions she</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>commendations go with pity; they are virtues and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>traitors too; in her they are the better for their</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LAFEU</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>COUNTESS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>’Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>in. The remembrance of her father never approaches</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a sorrow than have it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LAFEU</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>excessive grief the enemy to the living.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>COUNTESS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>makes it soon mortal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BERTRAM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Madam, I desire your holy wishes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LAFEU</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How understand we that?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>COUNTESS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Under thy own life’s key: be cheque’d for silence,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But never tax’d for speech. What heaven more will,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>’Tis an unseason’d courtier; good my lord,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Advise him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LAFEU</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He cannot want the best</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That shall attend his love.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>COUNTESS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BERTRAM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[To HELENA] The best wishes that can be forged in</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>your thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortable</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LAFEU</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>your father.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O, were that all! I think not on my father;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And these great tears grace his remembrance more</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Than those I shed for him. What was he like?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I have forgot him: my imagination</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Carries no favour in’t but Bertram’s.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I am undone: there is no living, none,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If Bertram be away. ’Twere all one</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That I should love a bright particular star</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And think to wed it, he is so above me:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In his bright radiance and collateral light</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The hind that would be mated by the lion</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Must die for love. ’Twas pretty, though plague,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To see him every hour; to sit and draw</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In our heart’s table; heart too capable</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But now he’s gone, and my idolatrous fancy</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter PAROLLES</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Aside</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And yet I know him a notorious liar,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That they take place, when virtue’s steely bones</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Look bleak i’ the cold wind: withal, full oft we see</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PAROLLES</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Save you, fair queen!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And you, monarch!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PAROLLES</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And no.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PAROLLES</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you meditating on virginity?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>may we barricado it against him?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PAROLLES</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep him out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>warlike resistance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PAROLLES</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is none: man, sitting down before you, will</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>undermine you and blow you up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bless our poor virginity from underminers and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>blowers up! Is there no military policy, how</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>virgins might blow up men?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PAROLLES</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>increase and there was never virgin got till</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>virginity was first lost. That you were made of is</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ever lost: ’tis too cold a companion; away with ’t!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will stand for ’t a little, though therefore I die a virgin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PAROLLES</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s little can be said in ’t; ’tis against the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>virginity murders itself and should be buried in</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>by’t: out with ’t! within ten year it will make</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>principal itself not much the worse: away with ’t!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PAROLLES</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne’er it</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>likes. ’Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with ’t</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>while ’tis vendible; answer the time of request.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>now. Your date is better in your pie and your</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>your old virginity, is like one of our French</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>’tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>marry, yet ’tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not my virginity yet [ ]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There shall your master have a thousand loves,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A mother and a mistress and a friend,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A phoenix, captain and an enemy,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>His humble ambition, proud humility,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he–</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I know not what he shall. God send him well!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The court’s a learning place, and he is one–</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PAROLLES</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What one, i’ faith?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That I wish well. ’Tis pity–</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PAROLLES</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What’s pity?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELENA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That wishing well had not a body in’t,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Might with effects of them follow our friends,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And show what we alone must think, which never</p>

<p>Return us thanks.</p>

<p><strong>First Lord</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Young Bertram.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>KING</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Youth, thou bear’st thy father’s face;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,</p>

<p>Hath well composed thee. Thy father’s moral parts</p>

<p>I would I had that corporal soundness now,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As when thy father and myself in friendship</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>First tried our soldiership! He did look far</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Into the service of the time and was</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But on us both did haggish age steal on</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And wore us out of act. It much repairs me</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To talk of your good father. In his youth</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He had the wit which I can well observe</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To-day in our young lords; but they may jest</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Till their own scorn return to them unnoted</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ere they can hide their levity in honour;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>His equal had awaked them, and his honour,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Clock to itself, knew the true minute when</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Exception bid him speak, and at this time</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>His tongue obey’d his hand: who were below him</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He used as creatures of another place</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And bow’d his eminent top to their low ranks,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Making them proud of his humility,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Might be a copy to these younger times;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Which, follow’d well, would demonstrate them now</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But goers backward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BERTRAM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>His good remembrance, sir,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So in approof lives not his epitaph</p>

<p>As in your royal speech.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>KING</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would I were with him! He would always say–</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He scatter’d not in ears, but grafted them,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To grow there and to bear,–‘Let me not live,’–</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This his good melancholy oft began,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When it was out,–‘Let me not live,’ quoth he,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>’After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All but new things disdain; whose judgments are</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Expire before their fashions.’ This he wish’d;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I after him do after him wish too,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I quickly were dissolved from my hive,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To give some labourers room.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>You are loved, sir:</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>I fill a place, I know’t. How long is’t, count,</p>

<p><strong>BERTRAM</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>If he were living, I would try him yet.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>With several applications; nature and sickness</p>

<p>Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, count;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How, I pray you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PAROLLES</strong></p>

<p>He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.</p>

<p><strong>KING</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How is that?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PAROLLES</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He loved her, sir, and loved her not.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>KING</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But wilt thou not speak all thou knowest?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PAROLLES</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, so please your majesty. I did go between them,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>as I said; but more than that, he loved her: for</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>indeed he was mad for her, and talked of Satan and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>of Limbo and of Furies and I know not what: yet I</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>was in that credit with them at that time that I</p>

<p>knew of their going to bed, and of other motions,</p>

<p>speak what I know.</p>

<p><strong>KING</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wherefore hast thou accused him all this while?</p>

<p><strong>DIANA</strong></p>

<p>Because he’s guilty, and he is not guilty:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He knows I am no maid, and he’ll swear to’t;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Though yet he never harm’d me, here I quit him:</p>

<p>And at that time he got his wife with child:</p>
