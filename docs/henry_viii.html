<blockquote>
<p>I come no more to make you laugh: things now,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That bear a weighty and a serious brow,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We now present. Those that can pity, here</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>May, if they think it well, let fall a tear;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The subject will deserve it. Such as give</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Their money out of hope they may believe,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>May here find truth too. Those that come to see</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Only a show or two, and so agree</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The play may pass, if they be still and willing,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ll undertake may see away their shilling</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Richly in two short hours. Only they</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That come to hear a merry bawdy play,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A noise of targets, or to see a fellow</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Will be deceived; for, gentle hearers, know,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To rank our chosen truth with such a show</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Our own brains, and the opinion that we bring,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To make that only true we now intend,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Will leave us never an understanding friend.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, for goodness’ sake, and as you are known</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The first and happiest hearers of the town,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Be sad, as we would make ye: think ye see</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The very persons of our noble story</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As they were living; think you see them great,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And follow’d with the general throng and sweat</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of thousand friends; then in a moment, see</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How soon this mightiness meets misery:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And, if you can be merry then, I’ll say</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A man may weep upon his wedding-day.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter NORFOLK at one door; at the other, BUCKINGHAM and ABERGAVENNY</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since last we saw in France?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NORFOLK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I thank your grace,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Healthful; and ever since a fresh admirer</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of what I saw there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An untimely ague</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Stay’d me a prisoner in my chamber when</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Those suns of glory, those two lights of men,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Met in the vale of Andren.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NORFOLK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>’Twixt Guynes and Arde:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I was then present, saw them salute on horseback;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Beheld them, when they lighted, how they clung</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In their embracement, as they grew together;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Which had they, what four throned ones could have weigh’d</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Such a compounded one?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All the whole time</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I was my chamber’s prisoner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NORFOLK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then you lost</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The view of earthly glory: men might say,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Till this time pomp was single, but now married</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To one above itself. Each following day</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Became the next day’s master, till the last</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Made former wonders its. To-day the French,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Shone down the English; and, to-morrow, they</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Made Britain India: every man that stood</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Show’d like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As cherubins, all guilt: the madams too,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Not used to toil, did almost sweat to bear</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The pride upon them, that their very labour</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Was to them as a painting: now this masque</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Was cried incomparable; and the ensuing night</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As presence did present them; him in eye,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Still him in praise: and, being present both</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>’Twas said they saw but one; and no discerner</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns–</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For so they phrase ’em–by their heralds challenged</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The noble spirits to arms, they did perform</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Beyond thought’s compass; that former fabulous story,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Being now seen possible enough, got credit,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That Bevis was believed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O, you go far.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NORFOLK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I belong to worship and affect</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In honour honesty, the tract of every thing</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Would by a good discourser lose some life,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Which action’s self was tongue to. All was royal;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To the disposing of it nought rebell’d. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Order gave each thing view; the office did</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Distinctly his full function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who did guide,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I mean, who set the body and the limbs</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of this great sport together, as you guess?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NORFOLK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>One, certes, that promises no element</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In such a business.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I pray you, who, my lord?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NORFOLK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All this was order’d by the good discretion</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of the right reverend Cardinal of York.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The devil speed him! no man’s pie is freed</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>From his ambitious finger. What had he</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That such a keech can with his very bulk</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Take up the rays o’ the beneficial sun</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And keep it from the earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NORFOLK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Surely, sir,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s in him stuff that puts him to these ends;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For, being not propp’d by ancestry, whose grace</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Chalks successors their way, nor call’d upon</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For high feats done to the crown; neither allied</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For eminent assistants; but, spider-like,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Out of his self-drawing web, he gives us note,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The force of his own merit makes his way</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A place next to the king.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ABERGAVENNY</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I cannot tell</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What heaven hath given him,–let some graver eye</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Pierce into that; but I can see his pride</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Peep through each part of him: whence has he that,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If not from hell? the devil is a niggard,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Or has given all before, and he begins</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A new hell in himself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why the devil,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Upon this French going out, took he upon him,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Without the privity o’ the king, to appoint</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Who should attend on him? He makes up the file</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of all the gentry; for the most part such</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To whom as great a charge as little honour</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He meant to lay upon: and his own letter,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The honourable board of council out,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Must fetch him in the papers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ABERGAVENNY</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do know</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>By this so sickened their estates, that never</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They shall abound as formerly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O, many</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Have broke their backs with laying manors on ’em</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For this great journey. What did this vanity</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But minister communication of</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A most poor issue?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NORFOLK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Grievingly I think,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The peace between the French and us not values</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The cost that did conclude it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every man,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>After the hideous storm that follow’d, was</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A thing inspired; and, not consulting, broke</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Into a general prophecy; That this tempest,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The sudden breach on’t.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NORFOLK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Which is budded out;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For France hath flaw’d the league, and hath attach’d</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Our merchants’ goods at Bourdeaux.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ABERGAVENNY</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is it therefore</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The ambassador is silenced?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NORFOLK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marry, is’t.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ABERGAVENNY</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A proper title of a peace; and purchased</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At a superfluous rate!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why, all this business</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Our reverend cardinal carried.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NORFOLK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like it your grace,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The state takes notice of the private difference</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Betwixt you and the cardinal. I advise you–</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And take it from a heart that wishes towards you</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Honour and plenteous safety–that you read</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The cardinal’s malice and his potency</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Together; to consider further that</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What his high hatred would effect wants not</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A minister in his power. You know his nature,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That he’s revengeful, and I know his sword</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hath a sharp edge: it’s long and, ’t may be said,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It reaches far, and where ’twill not extend,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You’ll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That I advise your shunning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Me, as his abject object: at this instant</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ll follow and outstare him.</p>

<p>Stay, my lord,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And let your reason with your choler question</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What ’tis you go about: to climb steep hills</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Requires slow pace at first: anger is like</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Self-mettle tires him. Not a man in England</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Can advise me like you: be to yourself</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As you would to your friend.</p>

<p><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And from a mouth of honour quite cry down</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That it do singe yourself: we may outrun,</p>

<p>And proofs as clear as founts in July when</p>

<p>As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or wolf, or both,–for he is equal ravenous</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As he is subtle, and as prone to mischief</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As able to perform’t; his mind and place</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To this last costly treaty, the interview,</p>

<p>That swallow’d so much treasure, and like a glass</p>

<p>Did break i’ the rinsing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NORFOLK</strong></p>

<p>Faith, and so it did.</p>

<p>As himself pleased; and they were ratified</p>

<p>As he cried ‘Thus let be’: to as much end</p>

<p>Has done this, and ’tis well; for worthy Wolsey,</p>

<p>Who cannot err, he did it. Now this follows,–</p>

<p>Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppy</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To the old dam, treason,–Charles the emperor,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Under pretence to see the queen his aunt–</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For ’twas indeed his colour, but he came</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To whisper Wolsey,–here makes visitation:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>His fears were, that the interview betwixt</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>England and France might, through their amity,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Breed him some prejudice; for from this league</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Peep’d harms that menaced him: he privily</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Deals with our cardinal; and, as I trow,–</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Which I do well; for I am sure the emperor</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Paid ere he promised; whereby his suit was granted</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ere it was ask’d; but when the way was made,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And paved with gold, the emperor thus desired,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That he would please to alter the king’s course,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And break the foresaid peace. Let the king know,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As soon he shall by me, that thus the cardinal</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And for his own advantage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NORFOLK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am sorry</p>

<p>To hear this of him; and could wish he were</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Something mistaken in’t.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have no further gone in this than by</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That is new-trimm’d, but benefit no further</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Than vainly longing. What we oft do best,</p>

<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not ours, or not allow’d; what worst, as oft,</p>

<p><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It grieves many:</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To nature none more bound; his training such,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That he may furnish and instruct great teachers,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And never seek for aid out of himself. Yet see,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When these so noble benefits shall prove</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Not well disposed, the mind growing once corrupt,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They turn to vicious forms, ten times more ugly</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Than ever they were fair. This man so complete,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who was enroll’d ’mongst wonders, and when we,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Almost with ravish’d listening, could not find</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>His hour of speech a minute; he, my lady,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hath into monstrous habits put the graces</p>

<p>That once were his, and is become as black</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As if besmear’d in hell. Sit by us; you shall hear–</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Surveyor</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, it was usual with him, every day</p>

<p>Should without issue die, he’ll carry it so</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To make the sceptre his: these very words</p>

<p>How grounded he his title to the crown,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Upon our fail? to this point hast thou heard him</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At any time speak aught?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Surveyor</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He was brought to this</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>By a vain prophecy of Nicholas Hopkins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What was that Hopkins?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Surveyor</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sir, a Chartreux friar,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>His confessor, who fed him every minute</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With words of sovereignty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How know’st thou this?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Surveyor</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not long before your highness sped to France,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The duke being at the Rose, within the parish</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Saint Lawrence Poultney, did of me demand</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What was the speech among the Londoners</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Concerning the French journey: I replied,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Men fear’d the French would prove perfidious,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To the king’s danger. Presently the duke</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Said, ’twas the fear, indeed; and that he doubted</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>’Twould prove the verity of certain words</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Spoke by a holy monk; ‘that oft,’ says he,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>’Hath sent to me, wishing me to permit</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>John de la Car, my chaplain, a choice hour</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To hear from him a matter of some moment:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whom after under the confession’s seal</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He solemnly had sworn, that what he spoke</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My chaplain to no creature living, but</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To me, should utter, with demure confidence</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This pausingly ensued: neither the king nor’s heirs,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Tell you the duke, shall prosper: bid him strive</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To gain the love o’ the commonalty: the duke</p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>If I know you well,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You were the duke’s surveyor, and lost your office</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You charge not in your spleen a noble person</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Go forward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Surveyor</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>On my soul, I’ll speak but truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I told my lord the duke, by the devil’s illusions</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The monk might be deceived; and that ’twas dangerous for him</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To ruminate on this so far, until</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It forged him some design, which, being believed,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It was much like to do: he answer’d, ’Tush,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It can do me no damage;’ adding further,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That, had the king in his last sickness fail’d,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The cardinal’s and Sir Thomas Lovell’s heads</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Should have gone off.</p>

<p>So are a number more.</p>

<p><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But, pray, how pass’d it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Gentleman</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ll tell you in a little. The great duke</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Came to the bar; where to his accusations</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He pleaded still not guilty and alleged</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The king’s attorney on the contrary</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Urged on the examinations, proofs, confessions</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of divers witnesses; which the duke desired</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To have brought viva voce to his face:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At which appear’d against him his surveyor;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor; and John Car,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Confessor to him; with that devil-monk,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hopkins, that made this mischief.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That was he</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That fed him with his prophecies?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Gentleman</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The same.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All these accused him strongly; which he fain</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Would have flung from him, but, indeed, he could not:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And so his peers, upon this evidence,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Have found him guilty of high treason. Much</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He spoke, and learnedly, for life; but all</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Was either pitied in him or forgotten.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>After all this, how did he bear himself?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Gentleman</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When he was brought again to the bar, to hear</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>His knell rung out, his judgment, he was stirr’d</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With such an agony, he sweat extremely,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And something spoke in choler, ill, and hasty:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But he fell to himself again, and sweetly</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In all the rest show’d a most noble patience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do not think he fears death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Gentleman</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sure, he does not:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He never was so womanish; the cause</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He may a little grieve at.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Certainly</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The cardinal is the end of this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>First Gentleman</strong></p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>Earl Surrey was sent thither, and in haste too,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lest he should help his father.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At his return</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>No doubt he will requite it. This is noted,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>For you or any: how far I have proceeded,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or how far further shall, is warranted</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That I gainsay my deed, how may he wound,</p>

<p>I am not of your wrong. Therefore in him</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But will you be more justified? You ever</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have wish’d the sleeping of this business; never desired</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It to be stirr’d; but oft have hinder’d, oft,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The passages made toward it: on my honour,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I speak my good lord cardinal to this point,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And thus far clear him. Now, what moved me to’t,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I will be bold with time and your attention:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Then mark the inducement. Thus it came; give heed to’t:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My conscience first received a tenderness,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter’d</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>By the Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Who had been hither sent on the debating</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A marriage ’twixt the Duke of Orleans and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Our daughter Mary: i’ the progress of this business,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ere a determinate resolution, he,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I mean the bishop, did require a respite;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Wherein he might the king his lord advertise</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether our daughter were legitimate,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes our brother’s wife. This respite shook</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The bosom of my conscience, enter’d me,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Yea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The region of my breast; which forced such way,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That many mazed considerings did throng</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And press’d in with this caution. First, methought</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I stood not in the smile of heaven; who had</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Commanded nature, that my lady’s womb,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If it conceived a male child by me, should</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do no more offices of life to’t than</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The grave does to the dead; for her male issue</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Or died where they were made, or shortly after</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This world had air’d them: hence I took a thought,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This was a judgment on me; that my kingdom,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Well worthy the best heir o’ the world, should not</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Be gladded in’t by me: then follows, that</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I weigh’d the danger which my realms stood in</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>By this my issue’s fail; and that gave to me</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Toward this remedy, whereupon we are</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now present here together: that’s to say,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I meant to rectify my conscience,–which</p>

<p><strong>LINCOLN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>So please your highness,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The question did at first so stagger me,</p>

<p>Bearing a state of mighty moment in’t</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And consequence of dread, that I committed</p>

<p><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></p>

<p>Of the good queen, but the sharp thorny points</p>

<p>To wear our mortal state to come with her,</p>

<p><strong>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>So please your highness,</p>

<p>The queen being absent, ’tis a needful fitness</p>

<p>That had not half a week to go, like rams</p>

<p><strong>Third Gentleman</strong></p>

<p>At length her grace rose, and with modest paces</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Then rose again and bow’d her to the people:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When by the Archbishop of Canterbury</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laid nobly on her: which perform’d, the choir,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With all the choicest music of the kingdom,</p>

<p><em>Enter KATHARINE, Dowager, sick; led between GRIFFITH, her gentleman usher, and PATIENCE, her woman</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>GRIFFITH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How does your grace?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>KATHARINE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O Griffith, sick to death!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My legs, like loaden branches, bow to the earth,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Willing to leave their burthen. Reach a chair:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So; now, methinks, I feel a little ease.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou led’st me,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That the great child of honour, Cardinal Wolsey, Was dead?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>GRIFFITH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, madam; but I think your grace,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Out of the pain you suffer’d, gave no ear to’t.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>KATHARINE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If well, he stepp’d before me, happily</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For my example.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>GRIFFITH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, the voice goes, madam:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For after the stout Earl Northumberland</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Arrested him at York, and brought him forward,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As a man sorely tainted, to his answer,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He fell sick suddenly, and grew so ill</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He could not sit his mule.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>KATHARINE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alas, poor man!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>GRIFFITH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lodged in the abbey; where the reverend abbot,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With all his covent, honourably received him;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To whom he gave these words, ’O, father abbot,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>An old man, broken with the storms of state,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Is come to lay his weary bones among ye;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Give him a little earth for charity!’</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So went to bed; where eagerly his sickness</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Pursued him still: and, three nights after this,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>About the hour of eight, which he himself</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Foretold should be his last, full of repentance,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He gave his honours to the world again,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>KATHARINE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>So may he rest; his faults lie gently on him!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And yet with charity. He was a man</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Himself with princes; one that, by suggestion,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Tied all the kingdom: simony was fair-play;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>His own opinion was his law: i’ the presence</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He would say untruths; and be ever double</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Both in his words and meaning: he was never,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But where he meant to ruin, pitiful:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>His promises were, as he then was, mighty;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But his performance, as he is now, nothing:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of his own body he was ill, and gave</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The clergy in example.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>GRIFFITH</strong></p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Men’s evil manners live in brass; their virtues</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We write in water. May it please your highness</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To hear me speak his good now?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>KATHARINE</strong></p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>GRIFFITH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This cardinal,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Though from an humble stock, undoubtedly</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Was fashion’d to much honour from his cradle.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Exceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lofty and sour to them that loved him not;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But to those men that sought him sweet as summer.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And though he were unsatisfied in getting,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Which was a sin, yet in bestowing, madam,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He was most princely: ever witness for him</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Those twins Of learning that he raised in you,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ipswich and Oxford! one of which fell with him,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The other, though unfinish’d, yet so famous,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So excellent in art, and still so rising,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>His overthrow heap’d happiness upon him;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For then, and not till then, he felt himself,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And found the blessedness of being little:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And, to add greater honours to his age</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Than man could give him, he died fearing God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>KATHARINE</strong></p>

They first congee unto her, then dance; and, at certain changes, the first two hold a spare garland over her head; at which the other four make reverent curtsies; then the two that held the garland deliver the same to the other next two, who observe the same order in their changes, and holding the garland over her head: which done, they deliver the same garland to the last two, who likewise observe the same order: at which, as it were by inspiration, she makes in her sleep signs of rejoicing, and holdeth up her hands to heaven: and so in their dancing vanish, carrying the garland with them.

<p><strong>GARDINER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dread sovereign, how much are we bound to heaven</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In daily thanks, that gave us such a prince;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Not only good and wise, but most religious:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One that, in all obedience, makes the church</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The chief aim of his honour; and, to strengthen</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That holy duty, out of dear respect,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>His royal self in judgment comes to hear</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The cause betwixt her and this great offender.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You were ever good at sudden commendations,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Bishop of Winchester. But know, I come not</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To hear such flattery now, and in my presence;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They are too thin and bare to hide offences.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To me you cannot reach, you play the spaniel,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And think with wagging of your tongue to win me;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But, whatsoe’er thou takest me for, I’m sure</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To CRANMER</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Good man, sit down. Now let me see the proudest</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He, that dares most, but wag his finger at thee:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By all that’s holy, he had better starve</p>

<p>May it please your grace,–</p>

<p><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, sir, it does not please me.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I had thought I had had men of some understanding</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And wisdom of my council; but I find none.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Was it discretion, lords, to let this man,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This good man,–few of you deserve that title,–</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This honest man, wait like a lousy footboy</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At chamber–door? and one as great as you are?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Why, what a shame was this! Did my commission</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Bid ye so far forget yourselves? I gave ye</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Power as he was a counsellor to try him,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Not as a groom: there’s some of ye, I see,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>More out of malice than integrity,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Would try him to the utmost, had ye mean;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which ye shall never have while I live.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Chancellor</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus far,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My most dread sovereign, may it like your grace</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To let my tongue excuse all. What was purposed</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Concerning his imprisonment, was rather,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If there be faith in men, meant for his trial,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And fair purgation to the world, than malice,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m sure, in me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, well, my lords, respect him;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Take him, and use him well, he’s worthy of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I will say thus much for him, if a prince</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>May be beholding to a subject, I</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Am, for his love and service, so to him.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Make me no more ado, but all embrace him:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Be friends, for shame, my lords! My Lord of</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Canterbury,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I have a suit which you must not deny me;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That is, a fair young maid that yet wants baptism,</p>

<p>You must be godfather, and answer for her.</p>

<p><strong>CRANMER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The greatest monarch now alive may glory</p>

<p>In such an honour: how may I deserve it</p>

<p>That am a poor and humble subject to you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Come, come, my lord, you’ld spare your spoons: you</p>

<p>shall have two noble partners with you; the old</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Duchess of Norfolk, and Lady Marquess Dorset: will</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>these please you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Once more, my Lord of Winchester, I charge you,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Embrace and love this man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>GARDINER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>With a true heart</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And brother-love I do it.</p>

<p><strong>CRANMER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And let heaven</p>

<p>Witness, how dear I hold this confirmation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good man, those joyful tears show thy true heart:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The common voice, I see, is verified</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of thee, which says thus, ’Do my Lord of Canterbury</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A shrewd turn, and he is your friend for ever.’</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Come, lords, we trifle time away; I long</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To have this young one made a Christian.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As I have made ye one, lords, one remain;</p>

<p>So I grow stronger, you more honour gain.</p>
