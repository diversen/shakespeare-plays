<p><em>Enter ORLANDO and ADAM</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ORLANDO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>are bred better; for, besides that they are fair</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>with their feeding, they are taught their manage,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>which his animals on his dunghills are as much</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>think is within me, begins to mutiny against this</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>know no wise remedy how to avoid it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ADAM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yonder comes my master, your brother.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ORLANDO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>shake me up.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter OLIVER</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OLIVER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, sir! what make you here?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ORLANDO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OLIVER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What mar you then, sir?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ORLANDO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OLIVER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ORLANDO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>come to such penury?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OLIVER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Know you where your are, sir?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ORLANDO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OLIVER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Know you before whom, sir?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ORLANDO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>you are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>condition of blood, you should so know me. The</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>you are the first-born; but the same tradition</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>you; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>nearer to his reverence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OLIVER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What, boy!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ORLANDO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OLIVER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ORLANDO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Rowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a villain that says such a father begot villains.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ADAM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sweet masters, be patient: for your father’s</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>remembrance, be at accord.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OLIVER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me go, I say.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ORLANDO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>father charged you in his will to give me good</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>education: you have trained me like a peasant,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>give me the poor allottery my father left me by</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OLIVER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>with you; you shall have some part of your will: I</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>pray you, leave me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ORLANDO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OLIVER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Get you with him, you old dog.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ADAM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is ‘old dog’ my reward? Most true, I have lost my</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>teeth in your service. God be with my old master!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>he would not have spoke such a word.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OLIVER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I will</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>crowns neither. Holla, Dennis!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter DENNIS</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DENNIS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Calls your worship?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OLIVER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Was not Charles, the duke’s wrestler, here to speak with me?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DENNIS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>So please you, he is here at the door and importunes</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>access to you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OLIVER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Call him in.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Exit DENNIS</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>’Twill be a good way; and to-morrow the wrestling is.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter CHARLES</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CHARLES</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good morrow to your worship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OLIVER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good Monsieur Charles, what’s the new news at the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>new court?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CHARLES</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s no news at the court, sir, but the old news:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>that is, the old duke is banished by his younger</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>brother the new duke; and three or four loving lords</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>therefore he gives them good leave to wander.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OLIVER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke’s daughter, be</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>banished with her father?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CHARLES</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O, no; for the duke’s daughter, her cousin, so loves</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>her, being ever from their cradles bred together,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>that she would have followed her exile, or have died</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>never two ladies loved as they do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OLIVER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where will the old duke live?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CHARLES</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a many merry men with him; and there they live like</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>carelessly, as they did in the golden world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OLIVER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CHARLES</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>to come in disguised against me to try a fall.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>well. Your brother is but young and tender; and,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>withal, that either you might stay him from his</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>run into, in that it is a thing of his own search</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and altogether against my will.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OLIVER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>myself notice of my brother’s purpose herein and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>it, but he is resolute. I’ll tell thee, Charles:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>of ambition, an envious emulator of every man’s</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>me his natural brother: therefore use thy</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>as his finger. And thou wert best look to’t; for if</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>against thee by poison, entrap thee by some</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>treacherous device and never leave thee till he</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>hath ta’en thy life by some indirect means or other;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>it, there is not one so young and so villanous this</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CHARLES</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>to-morrow, I’ll give him his payment: if ever he go</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>alone again, I’ll never wrestle for prize more: and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>so God keep your worship!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OLIVER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Farewell, good Charles.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Exit CHARLES</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>hates nothing more than he. Yet he’s gentle, never</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>in the heart of the world, and especially of my own</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>people, who best know him, that I am altogether</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>misprised: but it shall not be so long; this</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I kindle the boy thither; which now I’ll go about.</p>

<p><em>Exit</em></p>

<p><em>Enter CELIA and ROSALIND</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CELIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>teach me to forget a banished father, you must not</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CELIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>hadst been still with me, I could have taught my</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>tempered as mine is to thee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>rejoice in yours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CELIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>father perforce, I will render thee again in</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>affection; by mine honour, I will; and when I break</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>me see; what think you of falling in love?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CELIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>love no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>in honour come off again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What shall be our sport, then?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CELIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would we could do so, for her benefits are</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>doth most mistake in her gifts to women.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CELIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>’Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>makes honest, and those that she makes honest she</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>makes very ill-favouredly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nay, now thou goest from Fortune’s office to</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nature’s: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>not in the lineaments of Nature.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter TOUCHSTONE</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CELIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fortune makes Nature’s natural the cutter-off of</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nature’s wit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CELIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peradventure this is not Fortune’s work neither, but</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nature’s; who perceiveth our natural wits too dull</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>natural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>wit! whither wander you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mistress, you must come away to your father.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CELIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Were you made the messenger?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where learned you that oath, fool?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>were good pancakes and swore by his honour the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>mustard was naught: now I’ll stand to it, the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>yet was not the knight forsworn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CELIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How prove you that, in the great heap of your</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>knowledge?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>swear by your beards that I am a knave.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CELIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>By our beards, if we had them, thou art.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>By my knavery, if I had it, then I were; but if you</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CELIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prithee, who is’t that thou meanest?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>One that old Frederick, your father, loves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CELIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My father’s love is enough to honour him: enough!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>speak no more of him; you’ll be whipped for taxation</p>

<p>Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what’s the news?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LE BEAU</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CELIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sport! of what colour?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LE BEAU</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What colour, madam! how shall I answer you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As wit and fortune will.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Or as the Destinies decree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CELIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nay, if I keep not my rank,–</p>

<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou losest thy old smell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LE BEAU</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You tell us the manner of the wrestling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LE BEAU</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will tell you the beginning; and, if it please</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>your ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is</p>

<blockquote>
<p>yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming</p>

<blockquote>
<p>to perform it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CELIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LE BEAU</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There comes an old man and his three sons,–</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CELIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I could match this beginning with an old tale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LE BEAU</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>With bills on their necks, ’Be it known unto all men</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>by these presents.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LE BEAU</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>duke’s wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and broke three of his ribs, that there is little</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>hope of life in him: so he served the second, and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>their father, making such pitiful dole over them</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>that all the beholders take his part with weeping.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alas!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies</p>

<blockquote>
<p>have lost?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LE BEAU</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why, this that I speak of.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus men may grow wiser every day: it is the first</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport</p>

<blockquote>
<p>for ladies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CELIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Or I, I promise thee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But is there any else longs to see this broken music</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LE BEAU</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You must, if you stay here; for here is the place</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>perform it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CELIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay and see it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth:</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>ORLANDO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am more proud to be Sir Rowland’s son,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>His youngest son; and would not change that calling,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To be adopted heir to Frederick.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And all the world was of my father’s mind:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Had I before known this young man his son,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I should have given him tears unto entreaties,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ere he should thus have ventured.</p>

<blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p><strong>CELIA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ORLANDO</strong></p>
<blockquote>

<p>High commendation, true applause and love,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yet such is now the duke’s condition</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That he misconstrues all that you have done.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The duke is humorous; what he is indeed,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ORLANDO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I thank you, sir: and, pray you, tell me this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which of the two was daughter of the duke</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That here was at the wrestling?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LE BEAU</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The other is daughter to the banish’d duke,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And here detain’d by her usurping uncle,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To keep his daughter company; whose loves</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But I can tell you that of late this duke</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hath ta’en displeasure ’gainst his gentle niece,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Grounded upon no other argument</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But that the people praise her for her virtues</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And pity her for her good father’s sake;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And, on my life, his malice ’gainst the lady</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hereafter, in a better world than this,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ORLANDO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I rest much bounden to you: fare you well.</p>

<p>Almost to bursting, and the big round tears</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Coursed one another down his innocent nose</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First, for his weeping into the needless stream;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Poor deer,’ quoth he, ’thou makest a testament</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To that which had too much:’ then, being there alone,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Left and abandon’d of his velvet friends,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>‘’Tis right:’ quoth he; ’thus misery doth part</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The flux of company:’ anon a careless herd,</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And never stays to greet him; ‘Ay’ quoth Jaques,</p>

<p>‘Good morrow, fool,’ quoth I. ‘No, sir,’ quoth he,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:’</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Says very wisely, ’It is ten o’clock:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>’Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,</p>

<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>They have their exits and their entrances;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And one man in his time plays many parts,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And shining morning face, creeping like snail</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Seeking the bubble reputation</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In fair round belly with good capon lined,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Full of wise saws and modern instances;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Into the lean and slipper’d pantaloon,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Turning again toward childish treble, pipes</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That ends this strange eventful history,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Is second childishness and mere oblivion,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Seek him with candle; bring him dead or living</p>

<p>Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more</p>

<p>Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine</p>

<p><strong>ORLANDO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And thou, thrice-crowned queen of night, survey</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thy huntress’ name that my full life doth sway.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And in their barks my thoughts I’ll character;</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>CORIN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And how like you this shepherd’s life, Master Touchstone?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>life, but in respect that it is a shepherd’s life,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>like it very well; but in respect that it is</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>private, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>is it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CORIN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No more but that I know the more one sickens the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>means and content is without three good friends;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>that the property of rain is to wet and fire to</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>court, shepherd?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CORIN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, truly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then thou art damned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CORIN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nay, I hope.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Truly, thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg, all</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>on one side.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CORIN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For not being at court? Your reason.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawest</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>good manners; if thou never sawest good manners,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>state, shepherd.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CORIN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>behavior of the country is most mockable at the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>court. You told me you salute not at the court, but</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>uncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instance, briefly; come, instance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CORIN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>fells, you know, are greasy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why, do not your courtier’s hands sweat? and is not</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CORIN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Besides, our hands are hard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A more sounder instance, come.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CORIN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And they are often tarred over with the surgery of</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>courtier’s hands are perfumed with civet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most shallow man! thou worms-meat, in respect of a</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CORIN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have too courtly a wit for me: I’ll rest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>God make incision in thee! thou art raw.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CORIN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man’s</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>happiness, glad of other men’s good, content with my</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>graze and my lambs suck.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and the rams together and to offer to get your</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>twelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>damned for this, the devil himself will have no</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>shepherds; I cannot see else how thou shouldst</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>’scape.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CORIN</strong></p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>

<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>

<p>I’ll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it</p>

<blockquote>
<p>with a medlar: then it will be the earliest fruit</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ripe, and that’s the right virtue of the medlar.</p>

<p><strong>ORLANDO</strong></p>

<p>Who ambles Time withal?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>of heavy tedious penury; these Time ambles withal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ORLANDO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who doth he gallop withal?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>With a thief to the gallows, for though he go as</p>

<p>softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ORLANDO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who stays it still withal?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>ORLANDO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where dwell you, pretty youth?</p>

<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the</p>

<p><strong>ORLANDO</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your accent is something finer than you could</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have been told so of many: but indeed an old</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>him read many lectures against it, and I thank God</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I am not a woman, to be touched with so many</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>whole sex withal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ORLANDO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you remember any of the principal evils that he</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>laid to the charge of women?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There were none principal; they were all like one</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>another as half-pence are, every one fault seeming</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ORLANDO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I prithee, recount some of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>abuses our young plants with carving ‘Rosalind’ on</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>quotidian of love upon him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ORLANDO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>your remedy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is none of my uncle’s marks upon you: he</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ORLANDO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What were his marks?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>simply your having in beard is a younger brother’s</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>untied and every thing about you demonstrating a</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>careless desolation; but you are no such man; you</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>are rather point-device in your accoutrements as</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ORLANDO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>love believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>do than to confess she does: that is one of the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>points in the which women still give the lie to</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>is so admired?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ORLANDO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ORLANDO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the reason why they are not so punished and cured</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ORLANDO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did you ever cure any so?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>passion something and for no passion truly any</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>thing, as boys and women are for the most part</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>from his mad humour of love to a living humour of</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep’s</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in’t.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ORLANDO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would not be cured, youth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and come every day to my cote and woo me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ORLANDO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>where it is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go with me to it and I’ll show it you and by the way</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>you shall tell me where in the forest you live.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There was a pretty redness in his lip,</p>

<p>A little riper and more lusty red</p>

<p>called the Reply Churlish. If again ’it was not</p>

<p>well cut,’ he would answer, I spake not true: this</p>

<p><strong>JAQUES</strong></p>

<p>Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book; as you have</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>books for good manners: I will name you the degrees.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the</p>

<p>Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>parties were met themselves, one of them thought but</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>of an If, as, ‘If you said so, then I said so;’ and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the</p>

<p>I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,</p>

<p>That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Men of great worth resorted to this forest,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Address’d a mighty power; which were on foot,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In his own conduct, purposely to take</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>His brother here and put him to the sword:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And to the skirts of this wild wood he came;</p>

<p>Where meeting with an old religious man,</p>

<p>Both from his enterprise and from the world,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>His crown bequeathing to his banish’d brother,</p>

<p>And all their lands restored to them again</p>

<p><strong>DUKE SENIOR</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thou offer’st fairly to thy brothers’ wedding:</p>

<p>A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.</p>

<p>And after, every of this happy number</p>

<p>EPILOGUE</p>

<p><strong>ROSALIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>no bush, ’tis true that a good play needs no</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>epilogue; yet to good wine they do use good bushes,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and good plays prove the better by the help of good</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>you in the behalf of a good play! I am not</p>

<blockquote>
<p>furnished like a beggar, therefore to beg will not</p>

<p>become me: my way is to conjure you; and I’ll begin</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you bear to women–as I perceive by your simpering,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>none of you hates them–that between you and the</p>
</blockquote>

<p>women the play may please. If I were a woman I</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased</p>

<blockquote>
<p>me, complexions that liked me and breaths that I</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>defied not: and, I am sure, as many as have good</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>beards or good faces or sweet breaths will, for my</p>
</blockquote>

<p>kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.</p>
