<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter LEONATO, HERO, and BEATRICE, with a Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>comes this night to Messina.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Messenger</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>when I left him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Messenger</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But few of any sort, and none of name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Messenger</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>promise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>bettered expectation than you must expect of me to</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>tell you how.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>glad of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Messenger</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have already delivered him letters, and there</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>not show itself modest enough without a badge of</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>bitterness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did he break out into tears?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Messenger</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In great measure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>truer than those that are so washed. How much</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BEATRICE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>wars or no?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Messenger</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know none of that name, lady: there was none such</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>in the army of any sort.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is he that you ask for, niece?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Messenger</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O, he’s returned; and as pleasant as ever he was.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BEATRICE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Cupid at the flight; and my uncle’s fool, reading</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>he killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>but he’ll be meet with you, I doubt it not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Messenger</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BEATRICE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>excellent stomach.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Messenger</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And a good soldier too, lady.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BEATRICE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Messenger</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>honourable virtues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BEATRICE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>but for the stuffing,–well, we are all mortal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>they never meet but there’s a skirmish of wit</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>between them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BEATRICE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>now is the whole man governed with one: so that if</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>bear it for a difference between himself and his</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Messenger</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is’t possible?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BEATRICE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>next block.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Messenger</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BEATRICE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No; an he were, I would burn my study. But, I pray</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>you, who is his companion? Is there no young</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Messenger</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BEATRICE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>thousand pound ere a’ be cured.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Messenger</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will hold friends with you, lady.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BEATRICE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do, good friend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You will never run mad, niece.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BEATRICE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, not till a hot January.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Messenger</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don Pedro is approached.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, and BALTHASAR</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>cost, and you encounter it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>your grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and happiness takes his leave.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>is your daughter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Her mother hath many times told me so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>herself. Be happy, lady; for you are like an</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>honourable father.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>like him as she is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BEATRICE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedick: nobody marks you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BEATRICE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is it possible disdain should die while she hath</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>in her presence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>am loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and I</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>heart; for, truly, I love none.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BEATRICE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A dear happiness to women: they would else have</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>swear he loves me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>God keep your ladyship still in that mind! so some</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>gentleman or other shall ’scape a predestinate</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>scratched face.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BEATRICE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scratching could not make it worse, an ’twere such</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a face as yours were.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BEATRICE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>so good a continuer. But keep your way, i’ God’s</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>name; I have done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BEATRICE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You always end with a jade’s trick: I know you of old.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is the sum of all, Leonato. Signior Claudio</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the least a month; and he heartily prays some</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>hypocrite, but prays from his heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To DON JOHN</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the prince your brother, I owe you all duty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON JOHN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please it your grace lead on?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your hand, Leonato; we will go together.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Exeunt all except BENEDICK and CLAUDIO</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I noted her not; but I looked on her.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is she not a modest young lady?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why, i’ faith, methinks she’s too low for a high</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>praise, too brown for a fair praise and too little</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>for a great praise: only this commendation I can</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>afford her, that were she other than she is, she</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>were unhandsome; and being no other but as she is, I</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>do not like her.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>truly how thou likest her.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can the world buy such a jewel?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>with a sad brow? or do you play the flouting Jack,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>you, to go in the song?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>looked on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>matter: there’s her cousin, an she were not</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>as the first of May doth the last of December. But I</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>contrary, if Hero would be my wife.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is’t come to this? In faith, hath not the world</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Go to, i’ faith; an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sundays. Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Re-enter DON PEDRO</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What secret hath held you here, that you followed</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>not to Leonato’s?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would your grace would constrain me to tell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I charge thee on thy allegiance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumb</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>man; I would have you think so; but, on my</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>allegiance, mark you this, on my allegiance. He is</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>in love. With who? now that is your grace’s part.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Mark how short his answer is;–With Hero, Leonato’s</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>short daughter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this were so, so were it uttered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like the old tale, my lord: ’it is not so, nor</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>’twas not so, but, indeed, God forbid it should be</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>so.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>should be otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>By my troth, I speak my thought.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And, by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That I love her, I feel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That she is worthy, I know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That I neither feel how she should be loved nor</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>fire cannot melt out of me: I will die in it at the stake.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>of beauty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And never could maintain his part but in the force</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>of his will.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>brought me up, I likewise give her most humble</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>thanks: but that I will have a recheat winded in my</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>right to trust none; and the fine is, for the which</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I may go the finer, I will live a bachelor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>not with love: prove that ever I lose more blood</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>with love than I will get again with drinking, pick</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>out mine eyes with a ballad-maker’s pen and hang me</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>blind Cupid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>wilt prove a notable argument.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>at me; and he that hits me, let him be clapped on</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the shoulder, and called Adam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, as time shall try: ’In time the savage bull</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>doth bear the yoke.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull’s horns and set</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>them in my forehead: and let me be vilely painted,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and in such great letters as they write ’Here is</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>good horse to hire,’ let them signify under my sign</p>

<p>him but I am heart-burned an hour after.</p>

<p><strong>HERO</strong></p>

<p>He were an excellent man that were made just in the</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just, if he send me no husband; for the which</p>

<blockquote>
<p>blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel</p>

<p>and make him my waiting-gentlewoman? He that hath a</p>

<p>beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no</p>
</blockquote>

<p>beard is less than a man: and he that is more than</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>man, I am not for him: therefore, I will even take</p>

<p>No, but to the gate; and there will the devil meet</p>

<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>

<p>I am here already, sir.</p>

<p>I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much</p>

<blockquote>
<p>another man is a fool when he dedicates his</p>

<blockquote>
<p>behaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed at</p>

<blockquote>
<p>such shallow follies in others, become the argument</p>

<blockquote>
<p>of his own scorn by failing in love: and such a man</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>is Claudio. I have known when there was no music</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he</p>

<blockquote>
<p>rather hear the tabour and the pipe: I have known</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>when he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see a</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many</p>

<p>Come hither, Leonato. What was it you told me of</p>

<p>to-day, that your niece Beatrice was in love with</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Signior Benedick?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O, ay: stalk on. stalk on; the fowl sits. I did</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>never think that lady would have loved any man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, nor I neither; but most wonderful that she</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>should so dote on Signior Benedick, whom she hath in</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is’t possible? Sits the wind in that corner?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>of it but that she loves him with an enraged</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>affection: it is past the infinite of thought.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>May be she doth but counterfeit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Faith, like enough.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O God, counterfeit! There was never counterfeit of</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>passion came so near the life of passion as she</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>discovers it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why, what effects of passion shows she?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bait the hook well; this fish will bite.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What effects, my lord? She will sit you, you heard</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>my daughter tell you how.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>She did, indeed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How, how, pray you? You amaze me: I would have I</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>thought her spirit had been invincible against all</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>assaults of affection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would have sworn it had, my lord; especially</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>against Benedick.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I should think this a gull, but that the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>white-bearded fellow speaks it: knavery cannot,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>sure, hide himself in such reverence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He hath ta’en the infection: hold it up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No; and swears she never will: that’s her torment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>’Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: ’Shall</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I,’ says she, ’that have so oft encountered him</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>with scorn, write to him that I love him?’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This says she now when she is beginning to write to</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>him; for she’ll be up twenty times a night, and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>pretty jest your daughter told us of.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O, when she had writ it and was reading it over, she</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>railed at herself, that she should be so immodest</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>to write to one that she knew would flout her; ’I</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>measure him,’ says she, ’by my own spirit; for I</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>should flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though I</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>love him, I should.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses; ’O</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>sweet Benedick! God give me patience!’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>She doth indeed; my daughter says so: and the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>to herself: it is very true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It were good that Benedick knew of it by some</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>other, if she will not discover it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To what end? He would make but a sport of it and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>torment the poor lady worse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An he should, it were an alms to hang him. She’s an</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>excellent sweet lady; and, out of all suspicion,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>she is virtuous.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And she is exceeding wise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In every thing but in loving Benedick.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have just</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>cause, being her uncle and her guardian.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would she had bestowed this dotage on me: I would</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>have daffed all other respects and made her half</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>myself. I pray you, tell Benedick of it, and hear</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>what a’ will say.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Were it good, think you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>will die, if he love her not, and she will die, ere</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>she make her love known, and she will die, if he woo</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>her, rather than she will bate one breath of her</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>accustomed crossness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>She doth well: if she should make tender of her</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>love, ’tis very possible he’ll scorn it; for the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>man, as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He is a very proper man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He hath indeed a good outward happiness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before God! and, in my mind, very wise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And I take him to be valiant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Hector, I assure you: and in the managing of</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>quarrels you may say he is wise; for either he</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>avoids them with great discretion, or undertakes</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>them with a most Christian-like fear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If he do fear God, a’ must necessarily keep peace:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>if he break the peace, he ought to enter into a</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>quarrel with fear and trembling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And so will he do; for the man doth fear God,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>he will make. Well I am sorry for your niece. Shall</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>good counsel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nay, that’s impossible: she may wear her heart out first.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>let it cool the while. I love Benedick well; and I</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>how much he is unworthy so good a lady.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My lord, will you walk? dinner is ready.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>trust my expectation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let there be the same net spread for her; and that</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry. The</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>another’s dotage, and no such matter: that’s the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>scene that I would see, which will be merely a</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Coming forward] This can be no trick: the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>seems her affections have their full bent. Love me!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the love come from her; they say too that she will</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>rather die than give any sign of affection. I did</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>are they that hear their detractions and can put</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>them to mending. They say the lady is fair; ’tis a</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; ’tis</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>no great argument of her folly, for I will be</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>horribly in love with her. I may chance have some</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>because I have railed so long against marriage: but</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>doth not the appetite alter? a man loves the meat</p>

<blockquote>
<p>in his youth that he cannot endure in his age.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As much as may be yielded to a man:</p>

<p>Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;</p>

<p>All matter else seems weak: she cannot love,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,</p>

<p><strong>URSULA</strong></p>

<p><strong>HERO</strong></p>

<p>No, not to be so odd and from all fashions</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Out of myself, press me to death with wit.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore let Benedick, like cover’d fire,</p>

<p>It were a better death than die with mocks,</p>

<p><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></p>

<p>First, who think you the most desertless man to be</p>

<p>you with a good name: to be a well-favoured man is</p>

<p>You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>no boast of it; and for your writing and reading,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>let that appear when there is no need of such</p>

<blockquote>
<p>True, and they are to meddle with none but the</p>

<p>We will rather sleep than talk: we know what</p>

<p><strong>Watchman</strong></p>

<p>Why, then, let them alone till they are sober: if</p>

<p><strong>Watchman</strong></p>

<p>Well, sir.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></p>

<p>If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue</p>

<p><strong>Watchman</strong></p>

<p><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why, then, depart in peace, and let the child wake</p>

<p>the dark night, which did deceive them, but chiefly</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, Leonato,</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And in her eye there hath appear’d a fire,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To burn the errors that these princes hold</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Trust not my reading nor my observations,</p>

<p><strong>HERO</strong></p>

<p>They know that do accuse me; I know none:</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>FRIAR FRANCIS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is some strange misprision in the princes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two of them have the very bent of honour;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And if their wisdoms be misled in this,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know not. If they speak but truth of her,</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nor age so eat up my invention,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But they shall find, awaked in such a kind,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Both strength of limb and policy of mind,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ability in means and choice of friends,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To quit me of them throughly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FRIAR FRANCIS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pause awhile,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And let my counsel sway you in this case.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your daughter here the princes left for dead:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Let her awhile be secretly kept in,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And publish it that she is dead indeed;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Maintain a mourning ostentation</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And on your family’s old monument</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That appertain unto a burial.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What shall become of this? what will this do?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FRIAR FRANCIS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Change slander to remorse; that is some good:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But not for that dream I on this strange course,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But on this travail look for greater birth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>She dying, as it must so be maintain’d,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Upon the instant that she was accused,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Shall be lamented, pitied and excused</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of every hearer: for it so falls out</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That what we have we prize not to the worth</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack’d and lost,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Why, then we rack the value, then we find</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The virtue that possession would not show us</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When he shall hear she died upon his words,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea of her life shall sweetly creep</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Into his study of imagination,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And every lovely organ of her life</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Shall come apparell’d in more precious habit,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>More moving-delicate and full of life,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Into the eye and prospect of his soul,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If ever love had interest in his liver,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And wish he had not so accused her,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>No, though he thought his accusation true.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Let this be so, and doubt not but success</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Will fashion the event in better shape</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Than I can lay it down in likelihood.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But if all aim but this be levell’d false,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The supposition of the lady’s death</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Will quench the wonder of her infamy:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As best befits her wounded reputation,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In some reclusive and religious life,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries.</p>

<p>‘Nay,’ said I, ‘he hath the tongues:’ ’That I</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there’s a double tongue; there’s two tongues.’ Thus</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, daughter, and you gentle-women all,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And when I send for you, come hither mask’d. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Exeunt Ladies</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The prince and Claudio promised by this hour</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To visit me. You know your office, brother:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You must be father to your brother’s daughter</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And give her to young Claudio.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ANTONIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Which I will do with confirm’d countenance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FRIAR FRANCIS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To do what, signior?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To bind me, or undo me; one of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Signior Leonato, truth it is, good signior,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your niece regards me with an eye of favour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That eye my daughter lent her: ’tis most true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And I do with an eye of love requite her.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sight whereof I think you had from me,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>From Claudio and the prince: but what’s your will?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your answer, sir, is enigmatical:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But, for my will, my will is your good will</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>May stand with ours, this day to be conjoin’d</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the state of honourable marriage:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In which, good friar, I shall desire your help.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My heart is with your liking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FRIAR FRANCIS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And my help.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Here comes the prince and Claudio.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter DON PEDRO and CLAUDIO, and two or three others</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good morrow to this fair assembly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good morrow, prince; good morrow, Claudio:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We here attend you. Are you yet determined</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To-day to marry with my brother’s daughter?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ll hold my mind, were she an Ethiope.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Call her forth, brother; here’s the friar ready.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Exit ANTONIO</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what’s the matter,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That you have such a February face,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So full of frost, of storm and cloudiness?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think he thinks upon the savage bull.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Tush, fear not, man; we’ll tip thy horns with gold</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And all Europa shall rejoice at thee,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As once Europa did at lusty Jove,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When he would play the noble beast in love.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And some such strange bull leap’d your father’s cow,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And got a calf in that same noble feat</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Much like to you, for you have just his bleat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For this I owe you: here comes other reckonings.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Re-enter ANTONIO, with the Ladies masked</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Which is the lady I must seize upon?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ANTONIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This same is she, and I do give you her.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why, then she’s mine. Sweet, let me see your face.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, that you shall not, till you take her hand</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Before this friar and swear to marry her.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Give me your hand: before this holy friar,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I am your husband, if you like of me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And when I lived, I was your other wife:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Unmasking</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And when you loved, you were my other husband.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another Hero!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing certainer:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One Hero died defiled, but I do live,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And surely as I live, I am a maid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The former Hero! Hero that is dead!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>She died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FRIAR FRANCIS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All this amazement can I qualify:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When after that the holy rites are ended,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ll tell you largely of fair Hero’s death:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Meantime let wonder seem familiar,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And to the chapel let us presently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Soft and fair, friar. Which is Beatrice?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BEATRICE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Unmasking] I answer to that name. What is your will?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not you love me?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BEATRICE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why, no; no more than reason.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why, then your uncle and the prince and Claudio</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Have been deceived; they swore you did.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BEATRICE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not you love me?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Troth, no; no more than reason.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BEATRICE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why, then my cousin Margaret and Ursula</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Are much deceived; for they did swear you did.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>They swore that you were almost sick for me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BEATRICE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>’Tis no such matter. Then you do not love me?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BEATRICE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, truly, but in friendly recompense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And I’ll be sworn upon’t that he loves her;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For here’s a paper written in his hand,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fashion’d to Beatrice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HERO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And here’s another</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Writ in my cousin’s hand, stolen from her pocket,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Containing her affection unto Benedick.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A miracle! here’s our own hands against our hearts.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Come, I will have thee; but, by this light, I take</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>thee for pity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BEATRICE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would not deny you; but, by this good day, I yield</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>upon great persuasion; and partly to save your life,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>for I was told you were in a consumption.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peace! I will stop your mouth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kissing her</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How dost thou, Benedick, the married man?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ll tell thee what, prince; a college of</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>wit-crackers cannot flout me out of my humour. Dost</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>thou think I care for a satire or an epigram? No:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>if a man will be beaten with brains, a’ shall wear</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>purpose that the world can say against it; and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>therefore never flout at me for what I have said</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>against it; for man is a giddy thing, and this is my</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>conclusion. For thy part, Claudio, I did think to</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>have beaten thee, but in that thou art like to be my</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>kinsman, live unbruised and love my cousin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>that I might have cudgelled thee out of thy single</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>life, to make thee a double-dealer; which, out of</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>question, thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>exceedingly narrowly to thee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Come, come, we are friends: let’s have a dance ere</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>we are married, that we may lighten our own hearts</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and our wives’ heels.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LEONATO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ll have dancing afterward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, of my word; therefore play, music. Prince,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>thou art sad; get thee a wife, get thee a wife:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>there is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Messenger</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My lord, your brother John is ta’en in flight,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And brought with armed men back to Messina.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BENEDICK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Think not on him till to-morrow:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ll devise thee brave punishments for him.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Strike up, pipers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Dance</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
