,,Would not the beggar then forget himself?,0.1.39,
,First Huntsman,,,
,,"Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.",0.1.40,
,Second Huntsman,,,
,,It would seem strange unto him when he waked.,0.1.41,

,,Carry him gently to my fairest chamber,0.1.44,

,,But I am doubtful of your modesties;,0.1.94,
,,"Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,--",0.1.95,
,,For yet his honour never heard a play--,0.1.96,
