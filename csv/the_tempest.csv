,,,"Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!",1.1.6,
,,,"yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the",1.1.7,

,,Boatswain,,,
,,,Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your,1.1.14,
,,,cabins: you do assist the storm.,1.1.15,
,,GONZALO,,,
,,,"Nay, good, be patient.",1.1.16,
,,Boatswain,,,
,,,When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers,1.1.17,

,,GONZALO,,,
,,,"Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.",1.1.19,
,,Boatswain,,,
,,,None that I more love than myself. You are a,1.1.20,
,,,counsellor; if you can command these elements to,1.1.21,
,,,"silence, and work the peace of the present, we will",1.1.22,
,,,not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you,1.1.23,
,,,"cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make",1.1.24,
,,,yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of,1.1.25,
,,,"the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Out",1.1.26,
,,,"of our way, I say.",1.1.27,
,,,,,Exit
,,GONZALO,,,
,,,I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he,1.1.28,
,,,hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is,1.1.29,
,,,"perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his",1.1.30,
,,,"hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable,",1.1.31,
,,,for our own doth little advantage. If he be not,1.1.32,
,,,"born to be hanged, our case is miserable.",1.1.33,

,,,"Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!",1.1.43,
,,,We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.,1.1.44,
,,GONZALO,,,
,,,I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were,1.1.45,
,,,no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an,1.1.46,
,,,unstanched wench.,1.1.47,
,,Boatswain,,,
,,,"Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to",1.1.48,

,,ANTONIO,,,
,,,We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:,1.1.55,
,,,This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning,1.1.56,
,,,The washing of ten tides!,1.1.57,
,,GONZALO,,,
,,,"He'll be hang'd yet,",1.1.58,
,,,Though every drop of water swear against it,1.1.59,
,,,And gape at widest to glut him.,1.1.60,
,,,,,"A confused noise within:   'Mercy on us!'--  'We split, we split!'--'Farewell, my wife and  children!'-- 'Farewell, brother!'--'We split, we split, we split!'"

,,GONZALO,,,
,,,Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an,1.1.63,
,,,"acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any",1.1.64,

,,MIRANDA,,,
,,,"If by your art, my dearest father, you have",1.2.1,
,,,"Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.",1.2.2,
,,,"The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,",1.2.3,
,,,"But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,",1.2.4,
,,,"Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered",1.2.5,
,,,"With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,",1.2.6,
,,,"Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,",1.2.7,
,,,"Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock",1.2.8,
,,,"Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.",1.2.9,
,,,"Had I been any god of power, I would",1.2.10,
,,,Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere,1.2.11,
,,,It should the good ship so have swallow'd and,1.2.12,

,,MIRANDA,,,
,,,More to know,1.2.25,

,,PROSPERO,,,
,,,The hour's now come;,1.2.43,
,,,The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;,1.2.44,

,,MIRANDA,,,
,,,'Tis far off,1.2.53,

,,,"Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and",1.2.67,
,,,She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father,1.2.68,
,,,Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir,1.2.69,

,,MIRANDA,,,
,,,O the heavens!,1.2.71,

,,,Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself,1.2.82,
,,,Of all the world I loved and to him put,1.2.83,
,,,The manage of my state; as at that time,1.2.84,
,,,Through all the signories it was the first,1.2.85,
,,,"And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed",1.2.86,
,,,"In dignity, and for the liberal arts",1.2.87,
,,,"Without a parallel; those being all my study,",1.2.88,
,,,The government I cast upon my brother,1.2.89,

,,MIRANDA,,,
,,,"Sir, most heedfully.",1.2.93,
,,PROSPERO,,,
,,,"Being once perfected how to grant suits,",1.2.94,

,,,"To trash for over-topping, new created",1.2.96,
,,,"The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,",1.2.97,
,,,Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key,1.2.98,

,,,"Made such a sinner of his memory,",1.2.117,
,,,"To credit his own lie, he did believe",1.2.118,
,,,He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution,1.2.119,
