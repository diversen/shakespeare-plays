,,"You came not of one mother then, it seems.",1.1.59,
,BASTARD,,,
,,"Most certain of one mother, mighty king;",1.1.60,
,,"That is well known; and, as I think, one father:",1.1.61,
,,But for the certain knowledge of that truth,1.1.62,

,,"Of that I doubt, as all men's children may.",1.1.64,
,QUEEN ELINOR,,,
,,"Out on thee, rude man! thou dost shame thy mother",1.1.65,

,BASTARD,,,
,,"I, madam? no, I have no reason for it;",1.1.67,
,,That is my brother's plea and none of mine;,1.1.68,

,,Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?,1.1.73,
,BASTARD,,,
,,"I know not why, except to get the land.",1.1.74,
,,But once he slander'd me with bastardy:,1.1.75,
,,"But whether I be as true begot or no,",1.1.76,
,,"That still I lay upon my mother's head,",1.1.77,
,,"But that I am as well begot, my liege,--",1.1.78,
,,Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!--,1.1.79,
,,Compare our faces and be judge yourself.,1.1.80,
,,If old sir Robert did beget us both,1.1.81,

,KING JOHN,,,
,,Mine eye hath well examined his parts,1.1.90,
,,"And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak,",1.1.91,
,,What doth move you to claim your brother's land?,1.1.92,

,,A half-faced groat five hundred pound a year!,1.1.95,
,ROBERT,,,
,,"My gracious liege, when that my father lived,",1.1.96,
,,"Your brother did employ my father much,--",1.1.97,
,BASTARD,,,
,,"Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:",1.1.98,
,,Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother.,1.1.99,
,ROBERT,,,
,,And once dispatch'd him in an embassy,1.1.100,
,,"To Germany, there with the emperor",1.1.101,
,,To treat of high affairs touching that time.,1.1.102,
,,The advantage of his absence took the king,1.1.103,
,,And in the mean time sojourn'd at my father's;,1.1.104,
,,"Where how he did prevail I shame to speak,",1.1.105,
,,But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores,1.1.106,
,,"Between my father and my mother lay,",1.1.107,
,,"As I have heard my father speak himself,",1.1.108,
,,When this same lusty gentleman was got.,1.1.109,
,,Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath'd,1.1.110,
,,"His lands to me, and took it on his death",1.1.111,
,,That this my mother's son was none of his;,1.1.112,
,,"And if he were, he came into the world",1.1.113,
,,Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.,1.1.114,
,,"Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,",1.1.115,

,KING JOHN,,,
,,"Sirrah, your brother is legitimate;",1.1.117,
,,"Your father's wife did after wedlock bear him,",1.1.118,
,,"And if she did play false, the fault was hers;",1.1.119,
,,Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands,1.1.120,
,,"That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,",1.1.121,
,,"Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,",1.1.122,
,,Had of your father claim'd this son for his?,1.1.123,
,,"In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept",1.1.124,
,,This calf bred from his cow from all the world;,1.1.125,
,,"In sooth he might; then, if he were my brother's,",1.1.126,
,,"My brother might not claim him; nor your father,",1.1.127,
,,"Being none of his, refuse him: this concludes;",1.1.128,
,,My mother's son did get your father's heir;,1.1.129,

,ROBERT,,,
,,Shall then my father's will be of no force,1.1.131,
,,To dispossess that child which is not his?,1.1.132,
