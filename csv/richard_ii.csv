,,"Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,",1.1.2,
,,"Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son,",1.1.3,
,,"Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,",1.1.4,
,,"Which then our leisure would not let us hear,",1.1.5,
,,"Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?",1.1.6,
,JOHN OF GAUNT,,,
,,"I have, my liege.",1.1.7,
,KING RICHARD II,,,
,,"Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,",1.1.8,
,,If he appeal the duke on ancient malice;,1.1.9,
,,"Or worthily, as a good subject should,",1.1.10,
,,On some known ground of treachery in him?,1.1.11,
,JOHN OF GAUNT,,,
,,"As near as I could sift him on that argument,",1.1.12,
,,On some apparent danger seen in him,1.1.13,
,,"Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice.",1.1.14,
,KING RICHARD II,,,
,,"Then call them to our presence; face to face,",1.1.15,
,,"And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear",1.1.16,
,,The accuser and the accused freely speak:,1.1.17,
,,"High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,",1.1.18,
,,"In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.",1.1.19,
,,,,Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and THOMAS MOWBRAY
,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,,,
,,Many years of happy days befal,1.1.20,
,,"My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!",1.1.21,
,THOMAS MOWBRAY,,,
,,Each day still better other's happiness;,1.1.22,
,,"Until the heavens, envying earth's good hap,",1.1.23,
,,Add an immortal title to your crown!,1.1.24,
,KING RICHARD II,,,
,,"We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,",1.1.25,
,,As well appeareth by the cause you come;,1.1.26,
,,Namely to appeal each other of high treason.,1.1.27,
,,"Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object",1.1.28,
,,"Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?",1.1.29,
,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,,,
,,"First, heaven be the record to my speech!",1.1.30,
,,"In the devotion of a subject's love,",1.1.31,
,,"Tendering the precious safety of my prince,",1.1.32,
,,"And free from other misbegotten hate,",1.1.33,
,,Come I appellant to this princely presence.,1.1.34,
,,"Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,",1.1.35,
,,And mark my greeting well; for what I speak,1.1.36,
,,"My body shall make good upon this earth,",1.1.37,
,,Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.,1.1.38,
,,"Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,",1.1.39,
,,"Too good to be so and too bad to live,",1.1.40,
,,"Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,",1.1.41,
,,The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.,1.1.42,
,,"Once more, the more to aggravate the note,",1.1.43,
,,With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;,1.1.44,
,,"And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,",1.1.45,
,,What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove.,1.1.46,
,THOMAS MOWBRAY,,,
,,Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:,1.1.47,
,,"'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,",1.1.48,
,,"The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,",1.1.49,
,,Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;,1.1.50,
,,The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this:,1.1.51,
,,Yet can I not of such tame patience boast,1.1.52,
,,As to be hush'd and nought at all to say:,1.1.53,
,,"First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me",1.1.54,
,,From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;,1.1.55,
,,Which else would post until it had return'd,1.1.56,
,,These terms of treason doubled down his throat.,1.1.57,
,,"Setting aside his high blood's royalty,",1.1.58,
,,"And let him be no kinsman to my liege,",1.1.59,
,,"I do defy him, and I spit at him;",1.1.60,
,,Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:,1.1.61,
,,"Which to maintain I would allow him odds,",1.1.62,
,,"And meet him, were I tied to run afoot",1.1.63,
,,"Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,",1.1.64,
,,"Or any other ground inhabitable,",1.1.65,
,,Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.,1.1.66,
,,"Mean time let this defend my loyalty,",1.1.67,
,,"By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.",1.1.68,
,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,,,
,,"Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,",1.1.69,
,,"Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,",1.1.70,
,,"And lay aside my high blood's royalty,",1.1.71,
,,"Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.",1.1.72,
,,If guilty dread have left thee so much strength,1.1.73,
,,"As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:",1.1.74,
,,"By that and all the rites of knighthood else,",1.1.75,
,,"Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,",1.1.76,
,,"What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise.",1.1.77,
,THOMAS MOWBRAY,,,
,,I take it up; and by that sword I swear,1.1.78,
,,"Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,",1.1.79,
,,"I'll answer thee in any fair degree,",1.1.80,
,,Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:,1.1.81,
,,"And when I mount, alive may I not light,",1.1.82,
,,If I be traitor or unjustly fight!,1.1.83,
,KING RICHARD II,,,
,,What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?,1.1.84,
,,It must be great that can inherit us,1.1.85,
,,So much as of a thought of ill in him.,1.1.86,
,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,,,
,,"Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;",1.1.87,
,,That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles,1.1.88,
,,"In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,",1.1.89,
,,"The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,",1.1.90,
,,Like a false traitor and injurious villain.,1.1.91,
,,"Besides I say and will in battle prove,",1.1.92,
,,Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge,1.1.93,
,,"That ever was survey'd by English eye,",1.1.94,
,,That all the treasons for these eighteen years,1.1.95,
,,Complotted and contrived in this land,1.1.96,
,,Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.,1.1.97,
,,Further I say and further will maintain,1.1.98,
,,"Upon his bad life to make all this good,",1.1.99,
,,"That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,",1.1.100,
,,"Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,",1.1.101,
,,"And consequently, like a traitor coward,",1.1.102,
,,Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:,1.1.103,
,,"Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,",1.1.104,
,,"Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,",1.1.105,
,,To me for justice and rough chastisement;,1.1.106,
,,"And, by the glorious worth of my descent,",1.1.107,
,,"This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.",1.1.108,
,KING RICHARD II,,,
,,How high a pitch his resolution soars!,1.1.109,
,,"Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this?",1.1.110,
,THOMAS MOWBRAY,,,
,,"O, let my sovereign turn away his face",1.1.111,
,,"And bid his ears a little while be deaf,",1.1.112,
,,"Till I have told this slander of his blood,",1.1.113,
,,How God and good men hate so foul a liar.,1.1.114,
,KING RICHARD II,,,
,,"Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:",1.1.115,
,,"Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,",1.1.116,
,,"As he is but my father's brother's son,",1.1.117,
,,"Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow,",1.1.118,
,,Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood,1.1.119,
,,"Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize",1.1.120,
,,The unstooping firmness of my upright soul:,1.1.121,
,,"He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:",1.1.122,
,,Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.,1.1.123,
,THOMAS MOWBRAY,,,
,,"Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,",1.1.124,
,,"Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.",1.1.125,
,,Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais,1.1.126,
,,Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers;,1.1.127,
,,"The other part reserved I by consent,",1.1.128,
,,For that my sovereign liege was in my debt,1.1.129,
,,"Upon remainder of a dear account,",1.1.130,
,,Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:,1.1.131,
,,"Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death,",1.1.132,
,,I slew him not; but to my own disgrace,1.1.133,
,,Neglected my sworn duty in that case.,1.1.134,
,,"For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,",1.1.135,
,,The honourable father to my foe,1.1.136,
,,"Once did I lay an ambush for your life,",1.1.137,
,,A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul,1.1.138,
,,But ere I last received the sacrament,1.1.139,
,,"I did confess it, and exactly begg'd",1.1.140,
,,"Your grace's pardon, and I hope I had it.",1.1.141,
,,"This is my fault: as for the rest appeall'd,",1.1.142,
,,"It issues from the rancour of a villain,",1.1.143,
,,A recreant and most degenerate traitor,1.1.144,
,,Which in myself I boldly will defend;,1.1.145,
,,And interchangeably hurl down my gage,1.1.146,
,,"Upon this overweening traitor's foot,",1.1.147,
,,To prove myself a loyal gentleman,1.1.148,
,,Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.,1.1.149,
