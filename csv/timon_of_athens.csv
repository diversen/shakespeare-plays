,Poet,,,
,,"Ay, that's well known:",1.1.5,
,,"But what particular rarity? what strange,",1.1.6,
,,"Which manifold record not matches? See,",1.1.7,
,,Magic of bounty! all these spirits thy power,1.1.8,

,Merchant,,,
,,"O, 'tis a worthy lord.",1.1.11,
,Jeweller,,,
,,"Nay, that's most fix'd.",1.1.12,
,Merchant,,,
,,"A most incomparable man, breathed, as it were,",1.1.13,
,,To an untirable and continuate goodness:,1.1.14,
,,He passes.,1.1.15,
,,Jeweller:	I have a jewel here--,1.1.16,
,Merchant,,,
,,"O, pray, let's see't: for the Lord Timon, sir?",1.1.17,
,,"Jeweller:	If he will touch the estimate: but, for that--",1.1.18,
,Poet,,,
,,[Reciting to himself]  'When we for recompense have,1.1.19,

,,"You are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedication",1.1.25,
,,To the great lord.,1.1.26,
,Poet,,,
,,A thing slipp'd idly from me.,1.1.27,
,,"Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes",1.1.28,
,,From whence 'tis nourish'd: the fire i' the flint,1.1.29,
,,Shows not till it be struck; our gentle flame,1.1.30,
,,Provokes itself and like the current flies,1.1.31,
,,Each bound it chafes. What have you there?,1.1.32,
,Painter,,,
,,"A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?",1.1.33,
,Poet,,,

,Poet,,,
,,So 'tis: this comes off well and excellent.,1.1.37,
,Painter,,,
,,Indifferent.,1.1.38,
,Poet,,,
,,Admirable: how this grace,1.1.39,
,,Speaks his own standing! what a mental power,1.1.40,
,,This eye shoots forth! how big imagination,1.1.41,
,,Moves in this lip! to the dumbness of the gesture,1.1.42,
,,One might interpret.,1.1.43,
,Painter,,,
,,It is a pretty mocking of the life.,1.1.44,
,,Here is a touch; is't good?,1.1.45,
,Poet,,,
,,"I will say of it,",1.1.46,
,,It tutors nature: artificial strife,1.1.47,
,,"Lives in these touches, livelier than life.",1.1.48,
,,,,"Enter certain Senators, and pass over"
,Painter,,,
,,How this lord is follow'd!,1.1.49,

,,of visitors.,1.1.53,
,,"I have, in this rough work, shaped out a man,",1.1.54,
,,Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug,1.1.55,
,,With amplest entertainment: my free drift,1.1.56,
,,"Halts not particularly, but moves itself",1.1.57,
,,In a wide sea of wax: no levell'd malice,1.1.58,
,,Infects one comma in the course I hold;,1.1.59,
,,"But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,",1.1.60,
,,Leaving no tract behind.,1.1.61,
,Painter,,,
,,How shall I understand you?,1.1.62,
,Poet,,,
,,I will unbolt to you.,1.1.63,
,,"You see how all conditions, how all minds,",1.1.64,
,,As well of glib and slippery creatures as,1.1.65,

,,Their services to Lord Timon: his large fortune,1.1.67,
,,Upon his good and gracious nature hanging,1.1.68,
,,Subdues and properties to his love and tendance,1.1.69,
,,"All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-faced flatterer",1.1.70,
,,"To Apemantus, that few things loves better",1.1.71,
,,Than to abhor himself: even he drops down,1.1.72,
,,"The knee before him, and returns in peace",1.1.73,
,,Most rich in Timon's nod.,1.1.74,
,Painter,,,
,,I saw them speak together.,1.1.75,
,Poet,,,
,,"Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill",1.1.76,
,,Feign'd Fortune to be throned: the base o' the mount,1.1.77,

,,"One do I personate of Lord Timon's frame,",1.1.82,
,,Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her;,1.1.83,
,,Whose present grace to present slaves and servants,1.1.84,
,,Translates his rivals.,1.1.85,
,Painter,,,
,,'Tis conceived to scope.,1.1.86,
,,"This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,",1.1.87,
,,"With one man beckon'd from the rest below,",1.1.88,
,,Bowing his head against the sleepy mount,1.1.89,
,,"To climb his happiness, would be well express'd",1.1.90,
,,In our condition.,1.1.91,
,Poet,,,

,Poet,,,
,,When Fortune in her shift and change of mood,1.1.100,

,,'Tis common:,1.1.105,
,,A thousand moral paintings I can show,1.1.106,

,,To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen,1.1.109,
,,The foot above the head.,1.1.110,

,,he abides.,5.1.2,
,Poet,,,
,,What's to be thought of him? does the rumour hold,5.1.3,
,,"for true, that he's so full of gold?",5.1.4,
,Painter,,,
,,Certain: Alcibiades reports it; Phrynia and,5.1.5,
,,Timandra had gold of him: he likewise enriched poor,5.1.6,
,,straggling soldiers with great quantity: 'tis said,5.1.7,
,,he gave unto his steward a mighty sum.,5.1.8,
,Poet,,,
,,Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends.,5.1.9,
,Painter,,,
,,Nothing else: you shall see him a palm in Athens,5.1.10,
,,"again, and flourish with the highest. Therefore",5.1.11,
,,"'tis not amiss we tender our loves to him, in this",5.1.12,
,,supposed distress of his: it will show honestly in,5.1.13,
,,us; and is very likely to load our purposes with,5.1.14,

,,that goes of his having.,5.1.16,

,,What have you now to present unto him?,5.1.17,

,,"performance is ever the duller for his act; and,",5.1.24,
,,"but in the plainer and simpler kind of people, the",5.1.25,
,,deed of saying is quite out of use. To promise is,5.1.26,
