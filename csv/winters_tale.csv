,ACT I,,,,
,SCENE I. Antechamber in LEONTES' palace.,,,,
,,,,,Enter CAMILLO and ARCHIDAMUS
,,ARCHIDAMUS,,,
,,,"If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on",1.1.1,
,,,the like occasion whereon my services are now on,1.1.2,
,,,"foot, you shall see, as I have said, great",1.1.3,
,,,difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.,1.1.4,
,,CAMILLO,,,
,,,"I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia",1.1.5,
,,,means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.,1.1.6,
,,ARCHIDAMUS,,,
,,,Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be,1.1.7,
,,,justified in our loves; for indeed--,1.1.8,
,,CAMILLO,,,
,,,"Beseech you,--",1.1.9,
,,ARCHIDAMUS,,,
,,,"Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:",1.1.10,
,,,we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know,1.1.11,
,,,"not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,",1.1.12,
,,,"that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,",1.1.13,
,,,"may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse",1.1.14,
,,,us.,1.1.15,
,,CAMILLO,,,
,,,You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.,1.1.16,
,,ARCHIDAMUS,,,
,,,"Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me",1.1.17,
,,,and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.,1.1.18,
,,CAMILLO,,,
,,,Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.,1.1.19,
,,,They were trained together in their childhoods; and,1.1.20,
,,,"there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,",1.1.21,
,,,which cannot choose but branch now. Since their,1.1.22,
,,,more mature dignities and royal necessities made,1.1.23,
,,,"separation of their society, their encounters,",1.1.24,
,,,"though not personal, have been royally attorneyed",1.1.25,
,,,"with interchange of gifts, letters, loving",1.1.26,
,,,"embassies; that they have seemed to be together,",1.1.27,
,,,"though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and",1.1.28,
,,,"embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed",1.1.29,
,,,winds. The heavens continue their loves!,1.1.30,
,,ARCHIDAMUS,,,
,,,I think there is not in the world either malice or,1.1.31,
,,,matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable,1.1.32,
,,,comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a,1.1.33,
,,,gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came,1.1.34,
,,,into my note.,1.1.35,
,,CAMILLO,,,
,,,I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it,1.1.36,
,,,is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the,1.1.37,
,,,"subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on",1.1.38,
,,,crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to,1.1.39,
,,,see him a man.,1.1.40,
,,ARCHIDAMUS,,,
,,,Would they else be content to die?,1.1.41,
,,CAMILLO,,,
,,,Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should,1.1.42,
,,,desire to live.,1.1.43,
,,ARCHIDAMUS,,,
,,,"If the king had no son, they would desire to live",1.1.44,
,,,on crutches till he had one.,1.1.45,
,,,,,Exeunt
,SCENE II. A room of state in the same.,,,,
,,,,,"Enter LEONTES, HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, POLIXENES, CAMILLO, and Attendants"
,,POLIXENES,,,
,,,Nine changes of the watery star hath been,1.2.1,
,,,The shepherd's note since we have left our throne,1.2.2,
,,,Without a burthen: time as long again,1.2.3,
,,,"Would be find up, my brother, with our thanks;",1.2.4,
,,,"And yet we should, for perpetuity,",1.2.5,
,,,"Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,",1.2.6,
,,,"Yet standing in rich place, I multiply",1.2.7,
,,,With one 'We thank you' many thousands moe,1.2.8,
,,,That go before it.,1.2.9,
,,LEONTES,,,
,,,Stay your thanks a while;,1.2.10,
,,,And pay them when you part.,1.2.11,
,,POLIXENES,,,
,,,"Sir, that's to-morrow.",1.2.12,
,,,"I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance",1.2.13,
,,,Or breed upon our absence; that may blow,1.2.14,
,,,"No sneaping winds at home, to make us say",1.2.15,
,,,"'This is put forth too truly:' besides, I have stay'd",1.2.16,
,,,To tire your royalty.,1.2.17,
,,LEONTES,,,
,,,"We are tougher, brother,",1.2.18,
,,,Than you can put us to't.,1.2.19,
,,POLIXENES,,,
,,,No longer stay.,1.2.20,
,,LEONTES,,,
,,,One seven-night longer.,1.2.21,
,,POLIXENES,,,
,,,"Very sooth, to-morrow.",1.2.22,
,,LEONTES,,,
,,,We'll part the time between's then; and in that,1.2.23,
,,,I'll no gainsaying.,1.2.24,
,,POLIXENES,,,
,,,"Press me not, beseech you, so.",1.2.25,
,,,"There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,",1.2.26,
,,,"So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,",1.2.27,
,,,"Were there necessity in your request, although",1.2.28,
,,,'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs,1.2.29,
,,,Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder,1.2.30,
,,,Were in your love a whip to me; my stay,1.2.31,
,,,"To you a charge and trouble: to save both,",1.2.32,
,,,"Farewell, our brother.",1.2.33,
,,LEONTES,,,
,,,"Tongue-tied, our queen?",1.2.34,
,,,speak you.,1.2.35,
,,HERMIONE,,,
,,,"I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until",1.2.36,
,,,"You have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,",1.2.37,
,,,"Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure",1.2.38,
,,,All in Bohemia's well; this satisfaction,1.2.39,
,,,"The by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him,",1.2.40,
,,,He's beat from his best ward.,1.2.41,
,,LEONTES,,,
,,,"Well said, Hermione.",1.2.42,
,,HERMIONE,,,
,,,"To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:",1.2.43,
,,,"But let him say so then, and let him go;",1.2.44,
,,,"But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,",1.2.45,
,,,We'll thwack him hence with distaffs.,1.2.46,
,,,Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure,1.2.47,
,,,The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia,1.2.48,
,,,"You take my lord, I'll give him my commission",1.2.49,
,,,To let him there a month behind the gest,1.2.50,
,,,"Prefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,",1.2.51,
,,,I love thee not a jar o' the clock behind,1.2.52,
,,,What lady-she her lord. You'll stay?,1.2.53,
,,POLIXENES,,,
,,,"No, madam.",1.2.54,
,,HERMIONE,,,
,,,"Nay, but you will?",1.2.55,
,,POLIXENES,,,
,,,"I may not, verily.",1.2.56,
,,HERMIONE,,,
,,,Verily!,1.2.57,
,,,"You put me off with limber vows; but I,",1.2.58,
,,,Though you would seek to unsphere the,1.2.59,
,,,"stars with oaths,",1.2.60,
,,,"Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,",1.2.61,
,,,You shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's,1.2.62,
,,,As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?,1.2.63,
,,,"Force me to keep you as a prisoner,",1.2.64,
,,,Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees,1.2.65,
,,,"When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?",1.2.66,
,,,"My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'",1.2.67,
,,,One of them you shall be.,1.2.68,
,,POLIXENES,,,
,,,"Your guest, then, madam:",1.2.69,
,,,To be your prisoner should import offending;,1.2.70,
,,,Which is for me less easy to commit,1.2.71,
,,,Than you to punish.,1.2.72,
,,HERMIONE,,,
,,,"Not your gaoler, then,",1.2.73,
,,,"But your kind hostess. Come, I'll question you",1.2.74,
,,,Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:,1.2.75,
,,,You were pretty lordings then?,1.2.76,
,,POLIXENES,,,
,,,"We were, fair queen,",1.2.77,
,,,Two lads that thought there was no more behind,1.2.78,
,,,"But such a day to-morrow as to-day,",1.2.79,
,,,And to be boy eternal.,1.2.80,
,,HERMIONE,,,
,,,Was not my lord,1.2.81,
,,,The verier wag o' the two?,1.2.82,
,,POLIXENES,,,
,,,"We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,",1.2.83,
,,,And bleat the one at the other: what we changed,1.2.84,
,,,Was innocence for innocence; we knew not,1.2.85,
,,,"The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd",1.2.86,
,,,"That any did. Had we pursued that life,",1.2.87,
,,,And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd,1.2.88,
,,,"With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven",1.2.89,
,,,Boldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd,1.2.90,
,,,Hereditary ours.,1.2.91,
,,HERMIONE,,,
,,,By this we gather,1.2.92,
,,,You have tripp'd since.,1.2.93,
,,POLIXENES,,,
,,,O my most sacred lady!,1.2.94,
,,,Temptations have since then been born to's; for,1.2.95,
,,,In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;,1.2.96,
,,,Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes,1.2.97,
,,,Of my young play-fellow.,1.2.98,
,,HERMIONE,,,
,,,Grace to boot!,1.2.99,
,,,"Of this make no conclusion, lest you say",1.2.100,
,,,Your queen and I are devils: yet go on;,1.2.101,
,,,"The offences we have made you do we'll answer,",1.2.102,
,,,If you first sinn'd with us and that with us,1.2.103,
,,,You did continue fault and that you slipp'd not,1.2.104,
,,,With any but with us.,1.2.105,
,,LEONTES,,,
,,,Is he won yet?,1.2.106,
,,HERMIONE,,,
,,,He'll stay my lord.,1.2.107,
,,LEONTES,,,
,,,At my request he would not.,1.2.108,
,,,"Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest",1.2.109,
,,,To better purpose.,1.2.110,
,,HERMIONE,,,
,,,Never?,1.2.111,
,,LEONTES,,,
,,,"Never, but once.",1.2.112,
,,HERMIONE,,,
,,,What! have I twice said well? when was't before?,1.2.113,
,,,"I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's",1.2.114,
,,,As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless,1.2.115,
,,,Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.,1.2.116,
,,,Our praises are our wages: you may ride's,1.2.117,
,,,With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere,1.2.118,
,,,With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:,1.2.119,
,,,My last good deed was to entreat his stay:,1.2.120,
,,,"What was my first? it has an elder sister,",1.2.121,
,,,"Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!",1.2.122,
,,,But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?,1.2.123,
,,,"Nay, let me have't; I long.",1.2.124,
,,LEONTES,,,
,,,"Why, that was when",1.2.125,
,,,"Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,",1.2.126,
,,,Ere I could make thee open thy white hand,1.2.127,
,,,And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter,1.2.128,
,,,'I am yours for ever.',1.2.129,
,,HERMIONE,,,
,,,'Tis grace indeed.,1.2.130,
,,,"Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:",1.2.131,
,,,The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;,1.2.132,
,,,The other for some while a friend.,1.2.133,
,,LEONTES,,,
,,,"[Aside]	Too hot, too hot!",1.2.134,
,,,To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.,1.2.135,
,,,I have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances;,1.2.136,
,,,But not for joy; not joy. This entertainment,1.2.137,
,,,"May a free face put on, derive a liberty",1.2.138,
,,,"From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,",1.2.139,
,,,"And well become the agent; 't may, I grant;",1.2.140,
,,,"But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,",1.2.141,
,,,"As now they are, and making practised smiles,",1.2.142,
,,,"As in a looking-glass, and then to sigh, as 'twere",1.2.143,

,,,Art thou my boy?,1.2.146,
,,MAMILLIUS,,,

,,LEONTES,,,
,,,I' fecks!,1.2.148,
,,,"Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast",1.2.149,
,,,smutch'd thy nose?,1.2.150,
,,,"They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,",1.2.151,
,,,"We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:",1.2.152,
,,,"And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf",1.2.153,

,,,"Yes, if you will, my lord.",1.2.157,
,,LEONTES,,,
,,,"Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,",1.2.158,
,,,To be full like me: yet they say we are,1.2.159,
,,,"Almost as like as eggs; women say so,",1.2.160,
,,,That will say anything but were they false,1.2.161,
,,,"As o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false",1.2.162,
,,,As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes,1.2.163,
,,,"No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true",1.2.164,
,,,"To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,",1.2.165,
,,,Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!,1.2.166,
,,,Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?--may't be?--,1.2.167,
,,,Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:,1.2.168,

,,,Communicatest with dreams;--how can this be?--,1.2.170,
,,,"With what's unreal thou coactive art,",1.2.171,
,,,And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent,1.2.172,
,,,"Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,",1.2.173,
,,,"And that beyond commission, and I find it,",1.2.174,
,,,And that to the infection of my brains,1.2.175,
,,,And hardening of my brows.,1.2.176,
,,POLIXENES,,,
,,,What means Sicilia?,1.2.177,
,,HERMIONE,,,
,,,He something seems unsettled.,1.2.178,
,,POLIXENES,,,
,,,"How, my lord!",1.2.179,
,,,"What cheer? how is't with you, best brother?",1.2.180,
,,HERMIONE,,,
,,,You look as if you held a brow of much distraction,1.2.181,
,,,"Are you moved, my lord?",1.2.182,
,,LEONTES,,,
,,,"No, in good earnest.",1.2.183,
,,,"How sometimes nature will betray its folly,",1.2.184,
,,,"Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime",1.2.185,
,,,To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines,1.2.186,
,,,"Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil",1.2.187,
,,,"Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,",1.2.188,
,,,"In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,",1.2.189,
,,,"Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,",1.2.190,
,,,"As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:",1.2.191,
,,,"How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,",1.2.192,
,,,"This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,",1.2.193,
,,,Will you take eggs for money?,1.2.194,
,,MAMILLIUS,,,

,,LEONTES,,,
,,,"You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,",1.2.196,
,,,Are you so fond of your young prince as we,1.2.197,

,,,"My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:",1.2.202,

,,,embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his,5.2.53,
,,,daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old,5.2.54,
