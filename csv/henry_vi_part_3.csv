,,YORK,,,
,,,"While we pursued the horsemen of the north,",1.1.2,
,,,He slily stole away and left his men:,1.1.3,
,,,"Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,",1.1.4,
,,,"Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,",1.1.5,
,,,"Cheer'd up the drooping army; and himself,",1.1.6,
,,,"Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford, all abreast,",1.1.7,

,,NORFOLK,,,
,,,Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!,1.1.19,
,,RICHARD,,,
,,,Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head.,1.1.20,
,,WARWICK,,,
,,,"And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,",1.1.21,
,,,Before I see thee seated in that throne,1.1.22,
,,,"Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,",1.1.23,
,,,I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.,1.1.24,
,,,"This is the palace of the fearful king,",1.1.25,

,,,"Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house.",1.1.38,
,,WARWICK,,,
,,,"The bloody parliament shall this be call'd,",1.1.39,

,,,"And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowardice",1.1.41,
,,,Hath made us by-words to our enemies.,1.1.42,
,,YORK,,,

,,,"My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,",1.1.50,
,,,"Even in the chair of state: belike he means,",1.1.51,
,,,"Back'd by the power of Warwick, that false peer,",1.1.52,
,,,To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.,1.1.53,
,,,"Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father.",1.1.54,

,,,"But when the duke is slain, they'll quickly fly.",1.1.69,
,,KING HENRY VI,,,
,,,"Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,",1.1.70,

,,YORK,,,
,,,It must and shall be so: content thyself.,1.1.86,
,,WARWICK,,,
,,,Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be king.,1.1.87,
,,WESTMORELAND,,,
,,,He is both king and Duke of Lancaster;,1.1.88,
,,,And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain.,1.1.89,
,,WARWICK,,,

,,,"Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,",1.1.144,
,,,Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown?,1.1.145,
