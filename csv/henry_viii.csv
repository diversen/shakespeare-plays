,,"I come no more to make you laugh: things now,",1.0.1,
,,"That bear a weighty and a serious brow,",1.0.2,
,,"Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe,",1.0.3,
,,"Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,",1.0.4,
,,"We now present. Those that can pity, here",1.0.5,
,,"May, if they think it well, let fall a tear;",1.0.6,
,,The subject will deserve it. Such as give,1.0.7,
,,"Their money out of hope they may believe,",1.0.8,
,,May here find truth too. Those that come to see,1.0.9,
,,"Only a show or two, and so agree",1.0.10,
,,"The play may pass, if they be still and willing,",1.0.11,
,,I'll undertake may see away their shilling,1.0.12,
,,Richly in two short hours. Only they,1.0.13,
,,"That come to hear a merry bawdy play,",1.0.14,
,,"A noise of targets, or to see a fellow",1.0.15,
,,"In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,",1.0.16,
,,"Will be deceived; for, gentle hearers, know,",1.0.17,
,,To rank our chosen truth with such a show,1.0.18,
,,"As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting",1.0.19,
,,"Our own brains, and the opinion that we bring,",1.0.20,
,,"To make that only true we now intend,",1.0.21,
,,Will leave us never an understanding friend.,1.0.22,
,,"Therefore, for goodness' sake, and as you are known",1.0.23,
,,"The first and happiest hearers of the town,",1.0.24,
,,"Be sad, as we would make ye: think ye see",1.0.25,
,,The very persons of our noble story,1.0.26,
,,"As they were living; think you see them great,",1.0.27,
,,And follow'd with the general throng and sweat,1.0.28,
,,"Of thousand friends; then in a moment, see",1.0.29,
,,How soon this mightiness meets misery:,1.0.30,
,,"And, if you can be merry then, I'll say",1.0.31,
,,A man may weep upon his wedding-day.,1.0.32,
SCENE I. London. An ante-chamber in the palace.,,,,
,,,,"Enter NORFOLK at one door; at the other, BUCKINGHAM and ABERGAVENNY"
,BUCKINGHAM,,,
,,"Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done",1.1.1,
,,Since last we saw in France?,1.1.2,
,NORFOLK,,,
,,"I thank your grace,",1.1.3,
,,Healthful; and ever since a fresh admirer,1.1.4,
,,Of what I saw there.,1.1.5,
,BUCKINGHAM,,,
,,An untimely ague,1.1.6,
,,Stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when,1.1.7,
,,"Those suns of glory, those two lights of men,",1.1.8,
,,Met in the vale of Andren.,1.1.9,
,NORFOLK,,,
,,'Twixt Guynes and Arde:,1.1.10,
,,"I was then present, saw them salute on horseback;",1.1.11,
,,"Beheld them, when they lighted, how they clung",1.1.12,
,,"In their embracement, as they grew together;",1.1.13,
,,"Which had they, what four throned ones could have weigh'd",1.1.14,
,,Such a compounded one?,1.1.15,
,BUCKINGHAM,,,
,,All the whole time,1.1.16,
,,I was my chamber's prisoner.,1.1.17,
,NORFOLK,,,
,,Then you lost,1.1.18,
,,"The view of earthly glory: men might say,",1.1.19,
,,"Till this time pomp was single, but now married",1.1.20,
,,To one above itself. Each following day,1.1.21,
,,"Became the next day's master, till the last",1.1.22,
,,"Made former wonders its. To-day the French,",1.1.23,
,,"All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,",1.1.24,
,,"Shone down the English; and, to-morrow, they",1.1.25,
,,Made Britain India: every man that stood,1.1.26,
,,Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were,1.1.27,
,,"As cherubins, all guilt: the madams too,",1.1.28,
,,"Not used to toil, did almost sweat to bear",1.1.29,
,,"The pride upon them, that their very labour",1.1.30,
,,Was to them as a painting: now this masque,1.1.31,
,,Was cried incomparable; and the ensuing night,1.1.32,
,,"Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,",1.1.33,
,,"Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,",1.1.34,
,,"As presence did present them; him in eye,",1.1.35,
,,"Still him in praise: and, being present both",1.1.36,
,,'Twas said they saw but one; and no discerner,1.1.37,
,,Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns--,1.1.38,
,,For so they phrase 'em--by their heralds challenged,1.1.39,
,,"The noble spirits to arms, they did perform",1.1.40,
,,"Beyond thought's compass; that former fabulous story,",1.1.41,
,,"Being now seen possible enough, got credit,",1.1.42,
,,That Bevis was believed.,1.1.43,
,BUCKINGHAM,,,
,,"O, you go far.",1.1.44,
,NORFOLK,,,
,,As I belong to worship and affect,1.1.45,
,,"In honour honesty, the tract of every thing",1.1.46,
,,"Would by a good discourser lose some life,",1.1.47,
,,Which action's self was tongue to. All was royal;,1.1.48,
,,To the disposing of it nought rebell'd.,1.1.49,
,,Order gave each thing view; the office did,1.1.50,
,,Distinctly his full function.,1.1.51,
,BUCKINGHAM,,,
,,"Who did guide,",1.1.52,
,,"I mean, who set the body and the limbs",1.1.53,
,,"Of this great sport together, as you guess?",1.1.54,
,NORFOLK,,,
,,"One, certes, that promises no element",1.1.55,
,,In such a business.,1.1.56,
,BUCKINGHAM,,,
,,"I pray you, who, my lord?",1.1.57,
,NORFOLK,,,
,,All this was order'd by the good discretion,1.1.58,
,,Of the right reverend Cardinal of York.,1.1.59,
,BUCKINGHAM,,,
,,The devil speed him! no man's pie is freed,1.1.60,
,,From his ambitious finger. What had he,1.1.61,
,,To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder,1.1.62,
,,That such a keech can with his very bulk,1.1.63,
,,Take up the rays o' the beneficial sun,1.1.64,
,,And keep it from the earth.,1.1.65,
,NORFOLK,,,
,,"Surely, sir,",1.1.66,
,,There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends;,1.1.67,
,,"For, being not propp'd by ancestry, whose grace",1.1.68,
,,"Chalks successors their way, nor call'd upon",1.1.69,
,,For high feats done to the crown; neither allied,1.1.70,
,,"For eminent assistants; but, spider-like,",1.1.71,
,,"Out of his self-drawing web, he gives us note,",1.1.72,
,,The force of his own merit makes his way,1.1.73,
,,"A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys",1.1.74,
,,A place next to the king.,1.1.75,
,ABERGAVENNY,,,
,,I cannot tell,1.1.76,
,,"What heaven hath given him,--let some graver eye",1.1.77,
,,Pierce into that; but I can see his pride,1.1.78,
,,"Peep through each part of him: whence has he that,",1.1.79,
,,"If not from hell? the devil is a niggard,",1.1.80,
,,"Or has given all before, and he begins",1.1.81,
,,A new hell in himself.,1.1.82,
,BUCKINGHAM,,,
,,"Why the devil,",1.1.83,
,,"Upon this French going out, took he upon him,",1.1.84,
,,"Without the privity o' the king, to appoint",1.1.85,
,,Who should attend on him? He makes up the file,1.1.86,
,,Of all the gentry; for the most part such,1.1.87,
,,To whom as great a charge as little honour,1.1.88,
,,"He meant to lay upon: and his own letter,",1.1.89,
,,"The honourable board of council out,",1.1.90,
,,Must fetch him in the papers.,1.1.91,
,ABERGAVENNY,,,
,,I do know,1.1.92,
,,"Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have",1.1.93,
,,"By this so sickened their estates, that never",1.1.94,
,,They shall abound as formerly.,1.1.95,
,BUCKINGHAM,,,
,,"O, many",1.1.96,
,,Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em,1.1.97,
,,For this great journey. What did this vanity,1.1.98,
,,But minister communication of,1.1.99,
,,A most poor issue?,1.1.100,
,NORFOLK,,,
,,"Grievingly I think,",1.1.101,
,,The peace between the French and us not values,1.1.102,
,,The cost that did conclude it.,1.1.103,
,BUCKINGHAM,,,
,,"Every man,",1.1.104,
,,"After the hideous storm that follow'd, was",1.1.105,
,,"A thing inspired; and, not consulting, broke",1.1.106,
,,"Into a general prophecy; That this tempest,",1.1.107,
,,"Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded",1.1.108,
,,The sudden breach on't.,1.1.109,
,NORFOLK,,,
,,Which is budded out;,1.1.110,
,,"For France hath flaw'd the league, and hath attach'd",1.1.111,
,,Our merchants' goods at Bourdeaux.,1.1.112,
,ABERGAVENNY,,,
,,Is it therefore,1.1.113,
,,The ambassador is silenced?,1.1.114,
,NORFOLK,,,
,,"Marry, is't.",1.1.115,
,ABERGAVENNY,,,
,,A proper title of a peace; and purchased,1.1.116,
,,At a superfluous rate!,1.1.117,

,,"Why, all this business",1.1.118,
,,Our reverend cardinal carried.,1.1.119,
,NORFOLK,,,
,,"Like it your grace,",1.1.120,
,,The state takes notice of the private difference,1.1.121,
,,Betwixt you and the cardinal. I advise you--,1.1.122,
,,And take it from a heart that wishes towards you,1.1.123,
,,Honour and plenteous safety--that you read,1.1.124,
,,The cardinal's malice and his potency,1.1.125,
,,Together; to consider further that,1.1.126,
,,What his high hatred would effect wants not,1.1.127,
,,"A minister in his power. You know his nature,",1.1.128,
,,"That he's revengeful, and I know his sword",1.1.129,
,,"Hath a sharp edge: it's long and, 't may be said,",1.1.130,
,,"It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend,",1.1.131,

,,,,"Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, the purse borne before him,  certain of the Guard, and two Secretaries with  papers. CARDINAL WOLSEY in his passage fixeth his  eye on BUCKINGHAM, and BUCKINGHAM on him, both full of disdain"

,BUCKINGHAM,,,
,,"This butcher's cur is venom-mouth'd, and I",1.1.142,
,,Have not the power to muzzle him; therefore best,1.1.143,

,,To the king I'll say't; and make my vouch as strong,1.1.186,

,,"Or wolf, or both,--for he is equal ravenous",1.1.188,
,,"As he is subtle, and as prone to mischief",1.1.189,
,,As able to perform't; his mind and place,1.1.190,
,,"Infecting one another, yea, reciprocally--",1.1.191,
,,Only to show his pomp as well in France,1.1.192,

,,"To the old dam, treason,--Charles the emperor,",1.1.206,
,,Under pretence to see the queen his aunt--,1.1.207,

,,"And paved with gold, the emperor thus desired,",1.1.218,

,,Of the great Duke of Buckingham.,2.1.4,
,First Gentleman,,,
,,I'll save you,2.1.5,
,,"That labour, sir. All's now done, but the ceremony",2.1.6,
,,Of bringing back the prisoner.,2.1.7,
,Second Gentleman,,,
,,Were you there?,2.1.8,
,First Gentleman,,,
,,"Yes, indeed, was I.",2.1.9,

,First Gentleman,,,
,,You may guess quickly what.,2.1.11,
,Second Gentleman,,,
,,Is he found guilty?,2.1.12,
,First Gentleman,,,
,,"Yes, truly is he, and condemn'd upon't.",2.1.13,
,Second Gentleman,,,
,,I am sorry for't.,2.1.14,
,First Gentleman,,,
,,So are a number more.,2.1.15,
,Second Gentleman,,,
,,"But, pray, how pass'd it?",2.1.16,
,First Gentleman,,,
,,I'll tell you in a little. The great duke,2.1.17,
,,Came to the bar; where to his accusations,2.1.18,
,,He pleaded still not guilty and alleged,2.1.19,
,,Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.,2.1.20,
,,The king's attorney on the contrary,2.1.21,
,,"Urged on the examinations, proofs, confessions",2.1.22,
,,Of divers witnesses; which the duke desired,2.1.23,
,,To have brought viva voce to his face:,2.1.24,
,,At which appear'd against him his surveyor;,2.1.25,
,,"Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor; and John Car,",2.1.26,
,,"Confessor to him; with that devil-monk,",2.1.27,
,,"Hopkins, that made this mischief.",2.1.28,
,Second Gentleman,,,
,,That was he,2.1.29,
,,That fed him with his prophecies?,2.1.30,
,First Gentleman,,,
,,The same.,2.1.31,
,,All these accused him strongly; which he fain,2.1.32,
,,"Would have flung from him, but, indeed, he could not:",2.1.33,
,,"And so his peers, upon this evidence,",2.1.34,
,,Have found him guilty of high treason. Much,2.1.35,
,,"He spoke, and learnedly, for life; but all",2.1.36,
,,Was either pitied in him or forgotten.,2.1.37,
,Second Gentleman,,,
,,"After all this, how did he bear himself?",2.1.38,
,First Gentleman,,,
,,"When he was brought again to the bar, to hear",2.1.39,
,,"His knell rung out, his judgment, he was stirr'd",2.1.40,
,,"With such an agony, he sweat extremely,",2.1.41,
,,"And something spoke in choler, ill, and hasty:",2.1.42,
,,"But he fell to himself again, and sweetly",2.1.43,
,,In all the rest show'd a most noble patience.,2.1.44,
,Second Gentleman,,,
,,I do not think he fears death.,2.1.45,
,First Gentleman,,,
,,"Sure, he does not:",2.1.46,
,,He never was so womanish; the cause,2.1.47,
,,He may a little grieve at.,2.1.48,
,Second Gentleman,,,
,,Certainly,2.1.49,
,,The cardinal is the end of this.,2.1.50,
,First Gentleman,,,
,,"'Tis likely,",2.1.51,
,,"By all conjectures: first, Kildare's attainder,",2.1.52,
,,"Then deputy of Ireland; who removed,",2.1.53,
,,"Earl Surrey was sent thither, and in haste too,",2.1.54,
,,Lest he should help his father.,2.1.55,
,Second Gentleman,,,
,,That trick of state,2.1.56,
,,Was a deep envious one.,2.1.57,
,First Gentleman,,,
,,At his return,2.1.58,
,,"No doubt he will requite it. This is noted,",2.1.59,
,,"And generally, whoever the king favours,",2.1.60,
,,"The cardinal instantly will find employment,",2.1.61,
,,And far enough from court too.,2.1.62,
,Second Gentleman,,,
,,All the commons,2.1.63,
,,"Hate him perniciously, and, o' my conscience,",2.1.64,
,,Wish him ten fathom deep: this duke as much,2.1.65,
,,"They love and dote on; call him bounteous Buckingham,",2.1.66,
,,The mirror of all courtesy;--,2.1.67,
