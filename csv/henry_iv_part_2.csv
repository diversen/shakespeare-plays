,,Should be the father of some stratagem:,1.1.11,

,LORD BARDOLPH,,,
,,As good as heart can wish:,1.1.18,
,,The king is almost wounded to the death;,1.1.19,
,,"And, in the fortune of my lord your son,",1.1.20,
,,Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts,1.1.21,
,,Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John,1.1.22,
,,And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field;,1.1.23,

,,Saw you the field? came you from Shrewsbury?,1.1.30,
,LORD BARDOLPH,,,

,,On Tuesday last to listen after news.,1.1.35,
,,,,Enter TRAVERS
,LORD BARDOLPH,,,
,,"My lord, I over-rode him on the way;",1.1.36,

,TRAVERS,,,
,,"My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me back",1.1.40,

,,"A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,",1.1.43,
,,That stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse.,1.1.44,
,,He ask'd the way to Chester; and of him,1.1.45,
,,I did demand what news from Shrewsbury:,1.1.46,
,,He told me that rebellion had bad luck,1.1.47,
,,And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold.,1.1.48,
,,"With that, he gave his able horse the head,",1.1.49,
,,And bending forward struck his armed heels,1.1.50,
,,Against the panting sides of his poor jade,1.1.51,

,,Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers,1.1.63,
,,Give then such instances of loss?,1.1.64,
,LORD BARDOLPH,,,
,,"Who, he?",1.1.65,
,,He was some hilding fellow that had stolen,1.1.66,

,,,,Enter MORTON
,NORTHUMBERLAND,,,
,,"Yea, this man's brow, like to a title-leaf,",1.1.69,
,,Foretells the nature of a tragic volume:,1.1.70,

,,"Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night,",1.1.82,

,,"Being bruited once, took fire and heat away",1.1.125,
,,From the best temper'd courage in his troops;,1.1.126,

,,"Which once in him abated, all the rest",1.1.128,
