,THESEUS,,,
,,"Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour",1.1.1,
,,Draws on apace; four happy days bring in,1.1.2,
,,"Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow",1.1.3,
,,"This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,",1.1.4,
,,Like to a step-dame or a dowager,1.1.5,
,,Long withering out a young man revenue.,1.1.6,
,HIPPOLYTA,,,
,,Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;,1.1.7,
,,Four nights will quickly dream away the time;,1.1.8,
,,"And then the moon, like to a silver bow",1.1.9,
,,"New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night",1.1.10,
,,Of our solemnities.,1.1.11,
,THESEUS,,,
,,"Go, Philostrate,",1.1.12,
,,Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;,1.1.13,

,,"Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!",1.1.21,
,THESEUS,,,
,,"Thanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee?",1.1.22,
,EGEUS,,,
,,"Full of vexation come I, with complaint",1.1.23,
,,"Against my child, my daughter Hermia.",1.1.24,
,,"Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,",1.1.25,
,,This man hath my consent to marry her.,1.1.26,
,,"Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,",1.1.27,
,,This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child;,1.1.28,
,,"Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,",1.1.29,
,,And interchanged love-tokens with my child:,1.1.30,
,,"Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,",1.1.31,
,,"With feigning voice verses of feigning love,",1.1.32,
,,And stolen the impression of her fantasy,1.1.33,
,,"With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,",1.1.34,
,,"Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers",1.1.35,
,,Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:,1.1.36,
,,"With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart,",1.1.37,
,,"Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,",1.1.38,
,,"To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,",1.1.39,
,,Be it so she; will not here before your grace,1.1.40,
,,"Consent to marry with Demetrius,",1.1.41,
,,"I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,",1.1.42,
,,"As she is mine, I may dispose of her:",1.1.43,
,,Which shall be either to this gentleman,1.1.44,
,,"Or to her death, according to our law",1.1.45,
,,Immediately provided in that case.,1.1.46,
,THESEUS,,,
,,"What say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid:",1.1.47,
,,To you your father should be as a god;,1.1.48,
,,"One that composed your beauties, yea, and one",1.1.49,
,,To whom you are but as a form in wax,1.1.50,
,,By him imprinted and within his power,1.1.51,
,,To leave the figure or disfigure it.,1.1.52,
,,Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.,1.1.53,
,HERMIA,,,
,,So is Lysander.,1.1.54,
,THESEUS,,,
,,In himself he is;,1.1.55,
,,"But in this kind, wanting your father's voice,",1.1.56,
,,The other must be held the worthier.,1.1.57,
,HERMIA,,,
,,I would my father look'd but with my eyes.,1.1.58,
,THESEUS,,,
,,Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.,1.1.59,
,HERMIA,,,
,,I do entreat your grace to pardon me.,1.1.60,
,,"I know not by what power I am made bold,",1.1.61,
,,"Nor how it may concern my modesty,",1.1.62,
,,In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;,1.1.63,
,,But I beseech your grace that I may know,1.1.64,
,,"The worst that may befall me in this case,",1.1.65,
,,If I refuse to wed Demetrius.,1.1.66,
,THESEUS,,,
,,Either to die the death or to abjure,1.1.67,
,,For ever the society of men.,1.1.68,
,,"Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires;",1.1.69,
,,"Know of your youth, examine well your blood,",1.1.70,
,,"Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,",1.1.71,
,,"You can endure the livery of a nun,",1.1.72,
,,"For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,",1.1.73,
,,"To live a barren sister all your life,",1.1.74,
,,Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.,1.1.75,
,,"Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,",1.1.76,
,,To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;,1.1.77,
,,"But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,",1.1.78,
,,Than that which withering on the virgin thorn,1.1.79,
,,"Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.",1.1.80,
,HERMIA,,,
,,"So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,",1.1.81,
,,Ere I will my virgin patent up,1.1.82,
,,"Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke",1.1.83,
,,My soul consents not to give sovereignty.,1.1.84,
,THESEUS,,,
,,"Take time to pause; and, by the next new moon--",1.1.85,
,,"The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,",1.1.86,
,,For everlasting bond of fellowship--,1.1.87,
,,Upon that day either prepare to die,1.1.88,
,,"For disobedience to your father's will,",1.1.89,
,,"Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;",1.1.90,
,,Or on Diana's altar to protest,1.1.91,
,,For aye austerity and single life.,1.1.92,
,DEMETRIUS,,,
,,"Relent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yield",1.1.93,
,,Thy crazed title to my certain right.,1.1.94,
,LYSANDER,,,
,,"You have her father's love, Demetrius;",1.1.95,
,,Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.,1.1.96,
,EGEUS,,,
,,"Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love,",1.1.97,
,,And what is mine my love shall render him.,1.1.98,
,,"And she is mine, and all my right of her",1.1.99,
,,I do estate unto Demetrius.,1.1.100,
,LYSANDER,,,
,,"I am, my lord, as well derived as he,",1.1.101,
,,As well possess'd; my love is more than his;,1.1.102,
,,"My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,",1.1.103,
,,"If not with vantage, as Demetrius';",1.1.104,
,,"And, which is more than all these boasts can be,",1.1.105,
,,I am beloved of beauteous Hermia:,1.1.106,
,,Why should not I then prosecute my right?,1.1.107,
,,"Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,",1.1.108,
,,"Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,",1.1.109,
,,"And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,",1.1.110,
,,"Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,",1.1.111,
,,Upon this spotted and inconstant man.,1.1.112,
,THESEUS,,,
,,"I must confess that I have heard so much,",1.1.113,
,,And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;,1.1.114,
,,"But, being over-full of self-affairs,",1.1.115,
,,"My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;",1.1.116,
,,"And come, Egeus; you shall go with me,",1.1.117,
,,I have some private schooling for you both.,1.1.118,
,,"For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself",1.1.119,
,,To fit your fancies to your father's will;,1.1.120,
,,Or else the law of Athens yields you up--,1.1.121,
,,Which by no means we may extenuate--,1.1.122,
,,"To death, or to a vow of single life.",1.1.123,
,,"Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?",1.1.124,

,,"Or else misgraffed in respect of years,--",1.1.139,
,HERMIA,,,

,LYSANDER,,,
,,"Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,",1.1.143,

,,So quick bright things come to confusion.,1.1.151,
,HERMIA,,,
,,"If then true lovers have been ever cross'd,",1.1.152,
,,It stands as an edict in destiny:,1.1.153,
,,"Then let us teach our trial patience,",1.1.154,
,,"Because it is a customary cross,",1.1.155,
