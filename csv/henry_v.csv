,,CANTERBURY,,,
,,,"My lord, I'll tell you; that self bill is urged,",1.1.1,
,,,Which in the eleventh year of the last king's reign,1.1.2,
,,,"Was like, and had indeed against us pass'd,",1.1.3,
,,,But that the scambling and unquiet time,1.1.4,
,,,Did push it out of farther question.,1.1.5,
,,ELY,,,
,,,"But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?",1.1.6,
,,CANTERBURY,,,
,,,"It must be thought on. If it pass against us,",1.1.7,
,,,We lose the better half of our possession:,1.1.8,
,,,For all the temporal lands which men devout,1.1.9,
,,,By testament have given to the church,1.1.10,
,,,Would they strip from us; being valued thus:,1.1.11,
,,,"As much as would maintain, to the king's honour,",1.1.12,
,,,"Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,",1.1.13,
,,,Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;,1.1.14,
,,,"And, to relief of lazars and weak age,",1.1.15,

,,,A hundred almshouses right well supplied;,1.1.17,
,,,"And to the coffers of the king beside,",1.1.18,
,,,A thousand pounds by the year: thus runs the bill.,1.1.19,

,,,This would drink deep.,1.1.20,
,,CANTERBURY,,,
,,,'Twould drink the cup and all.,1.1.21,
,,ELY,,,
,,,But what prevention?,1.1.22,
,,CANTERBURY,,,
,,,The king is full of grace and fair regard.,1.1.23,
,,ELY,,,
,,,And a true lover of the holy church.,1.1.24,
,,CANTERBURY,,,
,,,The courses of his youth promised it not.,1.1.25,
,,,"The breath no sooner left his father's body,",1.1.26,
,,,"But that his wildness, mortified in him,",1.1.27,
,,,"Seem'd to die too; yea, at that very moment",1.1.28,
,,,"Consideration, like an angel, came",1.1.29,
,,,"And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,",1.1.30,
,,,"Leaving his body as a paradise,",1.1.31,
,,,To envelop and contain celestial spirits.,1.1.32,
,,,Never was such a sudden scholar made;,1.1.33,
,,,"Never came reformation in a flood,",1.1.34,
,,,"With such a heady currance, scouring faults",1.1.35,
,,,Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness,1.1.36,
,,,So soon did lose his seat and all at once,1.1.37,
,,,As in this king.,1.1.38,
,,ELY,,,
,,,We are blessed in the change.,1.1.39,
,,CANTERBURY,,,
,,,"Hear him but reason in divinity,",1.1.40,
,,,And all-admiring with an inward wish,1.1.41,
,,,You would desire the king were made a prelate:,1.1.42,
,,,"Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,",1.1.43,
,,,You would say it hath been all in all his study:,1.1.44,
,,,"List his discourse of war, and you shall hear",1.1.45,
,,,A fearful battle render'd you in music:,1.1.46,
,,,"Turn him to any cause of policy,",1.1.47,
,,,"The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,",1.1.48,
,,,"Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks,",1.1.49,
,,,"The air, a charter'd libertine, is still,",1.1.50,
,,,"And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,",1.1.51,
,,,To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences;,1.1.52,
,,,So that the art and practic part of life,1.1.53,
,,,Must be the mistress to this theoric:,1.1.54,
,,,"Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,",1.1.55,
,,,"Since his addiction was to courses vain,",1.1.56,
,,,"His companies unletter'd, rude and shallow,",1.1.57,
,,,"His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports,",1.1.58,
,,,"And never noted in him any study,",1.1.59,
,,,"Any retirement, any sequestration",1.1.60,
,,,From open haunts and popularity.,1.1.61,
,,ELY,,,
,,,The strawberry grows underneath the nettle,1.1.62,
,,,And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best,1.1.63,
,,,Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:,1.1.64,
,,,And so the prince obscured his contemplation,1.1.65,
,,,"Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,",1.1.66,
,,,"Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,",1.1.67,
,,,"Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.",1.1.68,
,,CANTERBURY,,,
,,,It must be so; for miracles are ceased;,1.1.69,
,,,And therefore we must needs admit the means,1.1.70,
,,,How things are perfected.,1.1.71,
,,ELY,,,
,,,"But, my good lord,",1.1.72,
,,,How now for mitigation of this bill,1.1.73,
,,,Urged by the commons? Doth his majesty,1.1.74,
,,,"Incline to it, or no?",1.1.75,
,,CANTERBURY,,,
,,,"He seems indifferent,",1.1.76,
,,,Or rather swaying more upon our part,1.1.77,
,,,Than cherishing the exhibiters against us;,1.1.78,
,,,"For I have made an offer to his majesty,",1.1.79,
,,,Upon our spiritual convocation,1.1.80,
,,,"And in regard of causes now in hand,",1.1.81,
,,,"Which I have open'd to his grace at large,",1.1.82,
,,,"As touching France, to give a greater sum",1.1.83,
,,,Than ever at one time the clergy yet,1.1.84,
,,,Did to his predecessors part withal.,1.1.85,
,,ELY,,,
,,,"How did this offer seem received, my lord?",1.1.86,
,,CANTERBURY,,,
,,,With good acceptance of his majesty;,1.1.87,
,,,"Save that there was not time enough to hear,",1.1.88,
,,,"As I perceived his grace would fain have done,",1.1.89,
,,,The severals and unhidden passages,1.1.90,
,,,Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms,1.1.91,
,,,And generally to the crown and seat of France,1.1.92,

,,ELY,,,
,,,What was the impediment that broke this off?,1.1.94,
,,CANTERBURY,,,
,,,The French ambassador upon that instant,1.1.95,
,,,"Craved audience; and the hour, I think, is come",1.1.96,
,,,To give him hearing: is it four o'clock?,1.1.97,
,,ELY,,,
,,,It is.,1.1.98,
,,CANTERBURY,,,
,,,"Then go we in, to know his embassy;",1.1.99,
,,,"Which I could with a ready guess declare,",1.1.100,
,,,Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.,1.1.101,

,,CANTERBURY,,,
,,,God and his angels guard your sacred throne,1.2.8,

,,KING HENRY V,,,
,,,"Sure, we thank you.",1.2.10,
,,,"My learned lord, we pray you to proceed",1.2.11,
,,,And justly and religiously unfold,1.2.12,
,,,Why the law Salique that they have in France,1.2.13,
,,,"Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim:",1.2.14,
,,,"And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,",1.2.15,
,,,"That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,",1.2.16,
,,,Or nicely charge your understanding soul,1.2.17,
,,,"With opening titles miscreate, whose right",1.2.18,
,,,Suits not in native colours with the truth;,1.2.19,
,,,For God doth know how many now in health,1.2.20,
,,,Shall drop their blood in approbation,1.2.21,
,,,Of what your reverence shall incite us to.,1.2.22,

,,,How you awake our sleeping sword of war:,1.2.24,
,,,"We charge you, in the name of God, take heed;",1.2.25,
,,,For never two such kingdoms did contend,1.2.26,
,,,Without much fall of blood; whose guiltless drops,1.2.27,
,,,"Are every one a woe, a sore complaint",1.2.28,
,,,'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords,1.2.29,
,,,That make such waste in brief mortality.,1.2.30,
,,,"Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;",1.2.31,

,,,That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd,1.2.33,
,,,As pure as sin with baptism.,1.2.34,
,,CANTERBURY,,,
,,,"Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,",1.2.35,
,,,"That owe yourselves, your lives and services",1.2.36,
,,,To this imperial throne. There is no bar,1.2.37,
,,,To make against your highness' claim to France,1.2.38,
,,,"But this, which they produce from Pharamond,",1.2.39,
,,,'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:',1.2.40,
,,,'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:',1.2.41,
,,,Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze,1.2.42,
,,,"To be the realm of France, and Pharamond",1.2.43,
,,,The founder of this law and female bar.,1.2.44,
,,,Yet their own authors faithfully affirm,1.2.45,
,,,"That the land Salique is in Germany,",1.2.46,
,,,Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;,1.2.47,
,,,"Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,",1.2.48,
,,,There left behind and settled certain French;,1.2.49,
,,,"Who, holding in disdain the German women",1.2.50,
,,,"For some dishonest manners of their life,",1.2.51,
,,,"Establish'd then this law; to wit, no female",1.2.52,
,,,Should be inheritrix in Salique land:,1.2.53,
,,,"Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,",1.2.54,
,,,Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.,1.2.55,
,,,Then doth it well appear that Salique law,1.2.56,
,,,Was not devised for the realm of France:,1.2.57,
,,,Nor did the French possess the Salique land,1.2.58,
,,,Until four hundred one and twenty years,1.2.59,
,,,"After defunction of King Pharamond,",1.2.60,
,,,Idly supposed the founder of this law;,1.2.61,
,,,Who died within the year of our redemption,1.2.62,
,,,Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great,1.2.63,
,,,"Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French",1.2.64,
,,,"Beyond the river Sala, in the year",1.2.65,
,,,"Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,",1.2.66,
,,,"King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,",1.2.67,
,,,"Did, as heir general, being descended",1.2.68,
,,,"Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,",1.2.69,
,,,Make claim and title to the crown of France.,1.2.70,
,,,"Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown",1.2.71,
,,,"Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male",1.2.72,

,,,"To find his title with some shows of truth,",1.2.74,
,,,"'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,",1.2.75,
,,,"Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,",1.2.76,
,,,"Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son",1.2.77,
,,,"To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son",1.2.78,
,,,"Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,",1.2.79,
,,,"Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,",1.2.80,
,,,"Could not keep quiet in his conscience,",1.2.81,
,,,"Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied",1.2.82,
,,,"That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,",1.2.83,
,,,"Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,",1.2.84,
,,,Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:,1.2.85,
,,,By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great,1.2.86,
,,,Was re-united to the crown of France.,1.2.87,
,,,"So that, as clear as is the summer's sun.",1.2.88,
,,,"King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,",1.2.89,
,,,"King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear",1.2.90,
,,,To hold in right and title of the female:,1.2.91,
,,,So do the kings of France unto this day;,1.2.92,
,,,Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law,1.2.93,
,,,"To bar your highness claiming from the female,",1.2.94,
,,,And rather choose to hide them in a net,1.2.95,
,,,Than amply to imbar their crooked titles,1.2.96,

,,KING HENRY V,,,
,,,May I with right and conscience make this claim?,1.2.98,
,,CANTERBURY,,,

,,,"though his affections are higher mounted than ours,",4.1.105,
,,,"yet, when they stoop, they stoop with the like",4.1.106,
,,,"wing. Therefore when he sees reason of fears, as we",4.1.107,
,,,"do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish",4.1.108,

,,,contented as in the king's company; his cause being,4.1.124,

,,WILLIAMS,,,
,,,That's more than we know.,4.1.126,
,,BATES,,,
,,,"Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we know",4.1.127,
,,,"enough, if we know we are the kings subjects: if",4.1.128,
,,,"his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes",4.1.129,
,,,the crime of it out of us.,4.1.130,

,,,"But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath",4.1.131,

,,,"arms and heads, chopped off in battle, shall join",4.1.133,
,,,together at the latter day and cry all 'We died at,4.1.134,
,,,"such a place;' some swearing, some crying for a",4.1.135,
,,,"surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind",4.1.136,
,,,"them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their",4.1.137,
,,,children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die,4.1.138,
,,,well that die in a battle; for how can they,4.1.139,
,,,"charitably dispose of any thing, when blood is their",4.1.140,
,,,"argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it",4.1.141,
,,,will be a black matter for the king that led them to,4.1.142,
,,,it; whom to disobey were against all proportion of,4.1.143,
,,,subjection.,4.1.144,
,,KING HENRY V,,,
,,,"So, if a son that is by his father sent about",4.1.145,
,,,"merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the",4.1.146,
,,,"imputation of his wickedness by your rule, should be",4.1.147,

,,,"servant, under his master's command transporting a",4.1.149,
,,,"sum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in",4.1.150,
,,,"many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the",4.1.151,
,,,business of the master the author of the servant's,4.1.152,
,,,damnation: but this is not so: the king is not,4.1.153,
,,,bound to answer the particular endings of his,4.1.154,
,,,"soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of",4.1.155,
,,,"his servant; for they purpose not their death, when",4.1.156,
,,,"they purpose their services. Besides, there is no",4.1.157,
,,,"king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to",4.1.158,
,,,"the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all",4.1.159,
,,,unspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them,4.1.160,
,,,the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder;,4.1.161,
,,,"some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of",4.1.162,
,,,"perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that",4.1.163,
,,,have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with,4.1.164,
,,,"pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have",4.1.165,
,,,"defeated the law and outrun native punishment,",4.1.166,
,,,"though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to",4.1.167,
,,,"fly from God: war is his beadle, war is vengeance;",4.1.168,
,,,so that here men are punished for before-breach of,4.1.169,
,,,the king's laws in now the king's quarrel: where,4.1.170,
,,,"they feared the death, they have borne life away;",4.1.171,
,,,"and where they would be safe, they perish: then if",4.1.172,
,,,"they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of",4.1.173,
,,,their damnation than he was before guilty of those,4.1.174,
,,,impieties for the which they are now visited. Every,4.1.175,
,,,subject's duty is the king's; but every subject's,4.1.176,
,,,soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in,4.1.177,
,,,"the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every",4.1.178,
,,,"mote out of his conscience: and dying so, death",4.1.179,
,,,"is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was",4.1.180,
,,,blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained:,4.1.181,
,,,"and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think",4.1.182,
,,,"that, making God so free an offer, He let him",4.1.183,
