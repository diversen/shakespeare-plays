,PANDARUS,,,
,,"Well, I have told you enough of this: for my part,",1.1.13,
,,I'll not meddle nor make no further. He that will,1.1.14,
,,have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.,1.1.15,
,TROILUS,,,
,,Have I not tarried?,1.1.16,
,PANDARUS,,,

,PANDARUS,,,
,,An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's--,1.1.40,

,,"would not, as they term it, praise her: but I would",1.1.43,

,,Reply not in how many fathoms deep,1.1.48,
,,They lie indrench'd. I tell thee I am mad,1.1.49,

,,Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me,1.1.60,
,,The knife that made it.,1.1.61,

,,I speak no more than truth.,1.1.62,

,PANDARUS,,,
,,I have had my labour for my travail; ill-thought on of,1.1.68,

,TROILUS,,,
,,"What, art thou angry, Pandarus? what, with me?",1.1.71,
,PANDARUS,,,
,,"Because she's kin to me, therefore she's not so fair",1.1.72,

,,fair on Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what care,1.1.74,
,,I? I care not an she were a black-a-moor; 'tis all one to me.,1.1.75,
,TROILUS,,,
,,Say I she is not fair?,1.1.76,
,PANDARUS,,,
,,I do not care whether you do or no. She's a fool to,1.1.77,
,,stay behind her father; let her to the Greeks; and so,1.1.78,

,,"Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,",1.1.87,
,,When with your blood you daily paint her thus.,1.1.88,
,,I cannot fight upon this argument;,1.1.89,
,,It is too starved a subject for my sword.,1.1.90,
,,"But Pandarus,--O gods, how do you plague me!",1.1.91,
,,I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar;,1.1.92,
,,And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo.,1.1.93,
,,As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.,1.1.94,

,,And whither go they?,1.2.3,
,ALEXANDER,,,
,,"Up to the eastern tower,",1.2.4,
,,"Whose height commands as subject all the vale,",1.2.5,
,,"To see the battle. Hector, whose patience",1.2.6,
,,"Is, as a virtue, fix'd, to-day was moved:",1.2.7,

,,"And, like as there were husbandry in war,",1.2.9,
,,"Before the sun rose he was harness'd light,",1.2.10,
,,And to the field goes he; where every flower,1.2.11,
,,"Did, as a prophet, weep what it foresaw",1.2.12,
,,In Hector's wrath.,1.2.13,
,CRESSIDA,,,
,,What was his cause of anger?,1.2.14,
,ALEXANDER,,,
,,"The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks",1.2.15,
,,"A lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector;",1.2.16,
,,They call him Ajax.,1.2.17,
,CRESSIDA,,,
,,Good; and what of him?,1.2.18,
,ALEXANDER,,,
,,"They say he is a very man per se,",1.2.19,
,,And stands alone.,1.2.20,

,,"So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs.",1.2.21,
,ALEXANDER,,,
,,"This man, lady, hath robbed many beasts of their",1.2.22,
,,"particular additions; he is as valiant as the lion,",1.2.23,
,,"churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant: a man",1.2.24,
,,into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his,1.2.25,
,,"valour is crushed into folly, his folly sauced with",1.2.26,
,,discretion: there is no man hath a virtue that he,1.2.27,
,,"hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he",1.2.28,
,,carries some stain of it: he is melancholy without,1.2.29,
,,"cause, and merry against the hair: he hath the",1.2.30,
,,"joints of every thing, but everything so out of joint",1.2.31,
,,"that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use,",1.2.32,
,,"or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight.",1.2.33,
,CRESSIDA,,,
,,"But how should this man, that makes",1.2.34,

,ALEXANDER,,,
,,They say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle and,1.2.36,

,,were you at Ilium?,1.2.47,
,CRESSIDA,,,
,,"This morning, uncle.",1.2.48,

,PANDARUS,,,
,,"True, he was so: I know the cause too: he'll lay",1.2.57,
,,"about him to-day, I can tell them that: and there's",1.2.58,
,,Troilus will not come far behind him: let them take,1.2.59,

,CRESSIDA,,,

,PANDARUS,,,
,,"Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.",1.2.62,
,CRESSIDA,,,
,,O Jupiter! there's no comparison.,1.2.63,
,PANDARUS,,,
,,"What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a",1.2.64,
,,man if you see him?,1.2.65,
,CRESSIDA,,,
,,"Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.",1.2.66,
,PANDARUS,,,
,,"Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.",1.2.67,
,CRESSIDA,,,
,,"Then you say as I say; for, I am sure, he is not Hector.",1.2.68,
,PANDARUS,,,
,,"No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.",1.2.69,
,CRESSIDA,,,
,,'Tis just to each of them; he is himself.,1.2.70,

,,"Condition, I had gone barefoot to India.",1.2.73,
,CRESSIDA,,,
,,He is not Hector.,1.2.74,
,PANDARUS,,,
,,"Himself! no, he's not himself: would a' were",1.2.75,
,,"himself! Well, the gods are above; time must friend",1.2.76,
,,"or end: well, Troilus, well: I would my heart were",1.2.77,
,,"in her body. No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus.",1.2.78,
,CRESSIDA,,,
,,Excuse me.,1.2.79,
,PANDARUS,,,
,,He is elder.,1.2.80,

,,Th' other's not come to't; you shall tell me another,1.2.82,

,,have his wit this year.,1.2.84,
,CRESSIDA,,,
,,"He shall not need it, if he have his own.",1.2.85,
,PANDARUS,,,
,,Nor his qualities.,1.2.86,

,,No matter.,1.2.87,

,,Nor his beauty.,1.2.88,
,CRESSIDA,,,
,,'Twould not become him; his own's better.,1.2.89,
,PANDARUS,,,
,,"You have no judgment, niece: Helen",1.2.90,
,,"herself swore th' other day, that Troilus, for",1.2.91,
,,"a brown favour--for so 'tis, I must confess,--",1.2.92,
,,"not brown neither,--",1.2.93,

,PANDARUS,,,
,,She praised his complexion above Paris.,1.2.97,
,CRESSIDA,,,
,,"Why, Paris hath colour enough.",1.2.98,
,PANDARUS,,,
,,So he has.,1.2.99,
,CRESSIDA,,,
,,Then Troilus should have too much: if she praised,1.2.100,
,,"him above, his complexion is higher than his; he",1.2.101,
,,"having colour enough, and the other higher, is too",1.2.102,
,,flaming a praise for a good complexion. I had as,1.2.103,
,,lief Helen's golden tongue had commended Troilus for,1.2.104,
,,a copper nose.,1.2.105,
,PANDARUS,,,
,,I swear to you. I think Helen loves him better than Paris.,1.2.106,
,CRESSIDA,,,
,,Then she's a merry Greek indeed.,1.2.107,
,PANDARUS,,,
,,"Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th' other",1.2.108,
,,"day into the compassed window,--and, you know, he",1.2.109,
,,"has not past three or four hairs on his chin,--",1.2.110,
,CRESSIDA,,,
,,"Indeed, a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his",1.2.111,
,,particulars therein to a total.,1.2.112,

,,"Why, he is very young: and yet will he, within",1.2.113,
,,"three pound, lift as much as his brother Hector.",1.2.114,
,CRESSIDA,,,
,,Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?,1.2.115,
,PANDARUS,,,
,,But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came,1.2.116,
,,and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin--,1.2.117,
,CRESSIDA,,,
,,Juno have mercy! how came it cloven?,1.2.118,
,PANDARUS,,,
,,"Why, you know 'tis dimpled: I think his smiling",1.2.119,

,CRESSIDA,,,
,,"O, he smiles valiantly.",1.2.121,
,PANDARUS,,,
,,Does he not?,1.2.122,
,CRESSIDA,,,
,,"O yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn.",1.2.123,

,,"I cannot choose but laugh, to think how she tickled",1.2.132,
,,"his chin: indeed, she has a marvellous white hand, I",1.2.133,
,,"must needs confess,--",1.2.134,
,CRESSIDA,,,
,,Without the rack.,1.2.135,

,CRESSIDA,,,
,,"Alas, poor chin! many a wart is richer.",1.2.137,
,PANDARUS,,,
,,But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laughed,1.2.138,
,,that her eyes ran o'er.,1.2.139,
,CRESSIDA,,,
,,With mill-stones.,1.2.140,
,PANDARUS,,,
,,And Cassandra laughed.,1.2.141,
,CRESSIDA,,,
,,But there was more temperate fire under the pot of,1.2.142,
,,her eyes: did her eyes run o'er too?,1.2.143,
,PANDARUS,,,
,,And Hector laughed.,1.2.144,
,CRESSIDA,,,
,,At what was all this laughing?,1.2.145,
,PANDARUS,,,
,,"Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus' chin.",1.2.146,
,CRESSIDA,,,
,,"An't had been a green hair, I should have laughed",1.2.147,
,,too.,1.2.148,
,PANDARUS,,,
,,They laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.,1.2.149,
,CRESSIDA,,,
,,What was his answer?,1.2.150,
,PANDARUS,,,
,,"Quoth she, 'Here's but two and fifty hairs on your",1.2.151,
,,"chin, and one of them is white.",1.2.152,
,CRESSIDA,,,
,,This is her question.,1.2.153,
,PANDARUS,,,
,,That's true; make no question of that. 'Two and,1.2.154,

,,"my husband? 'The forked one,' quoth he, 'pluck't",1.2.158,
,,"out, and give it him.' But there was such laughing!",1.2.159,
,,"and Helen so blushed, an Paris so chafed, and all the",1.2.160,
,,"rest so laughed, that it passed.",1.2.161,
,CRESSIDA,,,
,,So let it now; for it has been while going by.,1.2.162,
,PANDARUS,,,
,,"Well, cousin. I told you a thing yesterday; think on't.",1.2.163,
