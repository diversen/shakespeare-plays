,,,"O'erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes,",1.1.2,
,,,That o'er the files and musters of the war,1.1.3,
,,,"Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,",1.1.4,
,,,The office and devotion of their view,1.1.5,
,,,"Upon a tawny front: his captain's heart,",1.1.6,
,,,Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst,1.1.7,
,,,"The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,",1.1.8,
,,,And is become the bellows and the fan,1.1.9,
,,,To cool a gipsy's lust.,1.1.10,

,,CLEOPATRA,,,
,,,"If it be love indeed, tell me how much.",1.1.15,
,,MARK ANTONY,,,

,,,"You must not stay here longer, your dismission",1.1.29,
,,,"Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.",1.1.30,
,,,Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? both?,1.1.31,
,,,"Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen,",1.1.32,
,,,"Thou blushest, Antony; and that blood of thine",1.1.33,
,,,Is Caesar's homager: else so thy cheek pays shame,1.1.34,
,,,When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!,1.1.35,
,,MARK ANTONY,,,
,,,"Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch",1.1.36,
,,,Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space.,1.1.37,
,,,Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alike,1.1.38,
,,,Feeds beast as man: the nobleness of life,1.1.39,

,,CLEOPATRA,,,
,,,Excellent falsehood!,1.1.44,

,,DEMETRIUS,,,
,,,Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?,1.1.62,
,,PHILO,,,
,,,"Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony,",1.1.63,
,,,He comes too short of that great property,1.1.64,
,,,Which still should go with Antony.,1.1.65,
,,DEMETRIUS,,,
,,,I am full sorry,1.1.66,

,,,"pity to cast them away for nothing; though, between",1.2.145,
,,,"them and a great cause, they should be esteemed",1.2.146,
,,,"nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of",1.2.147,
,,,"this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty",1.2.148,
,,,times upon far poorer moment: I do think there is,1.2.149,

,,MARK ANTONY,,,
,,,She is cunning past man's thought.,1.2.152,
,,,,,Exit ALEXAS
,,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,,,
,,,"Alack, sir, no; her passions are made of nothing but",1.2.153,
,,,the finest part of pure love: we cannot call her,1.2.154,
,,,winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater,1.2.155,
,,,storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this,1.2.156,
,,,"cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a",1.2.157,
,,,shower of rain as well as Jove.,1.2.158,
,,MARK ANTONY,,,
,,,Would I had never seen her.,1.2.159,
,,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,,,
,,,"O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece",1.2.160,

,,,"Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When",1.2.168,
,,,it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man,1.2.169,
,,,"from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth;",1.2.170,
,,,"comforting therein, that when old robes are worn",1.2.171,
,,,"out, there are members to make new. If there were",1.2.172,
,,,"no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,",1.2.173,
,,,and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned,1.2.174,
,,,with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new,1.2.175,
,,,petticoat: and indeed the tears live in an onion,1.2.176,
,,,that should water this sorrow.,1.2.177,
,,MARK ANTONY,,,
,,,The business she hath broached in the state,1.2.178,

,,MARK ANTONY,,,
,,,No more light answers. Let our officers,1.2.183,
,,,Have notice what we purpose. I shall break,1.2.184,

,,,"The sides o' the world may danger: much is breeding,",1.2.199,
