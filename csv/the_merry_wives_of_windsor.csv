,,,"knaves, his hinds, were called forth by their",3.5.84,
,,,mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to,3.5.85,
,,,Datchet-lane: they took me on their shoulders; met,3.5.86,
,,,"the jealous knave their master in the door, who",3.5.87,
,,,asked them once or twice what they had in their,3.5.88,
,,,"basket: I quaked for fear, lest the lunatic knave",3.5.89,
,,,"would have searched it; but fate, ordaining he",3.5.90,
,,,"should be a cuckold, held his hand. Well: on went he",3.5.91,
,,,"for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But",3.5.92,
,,,"mark the sequel, Master Brook: I suffered the pangs",3.5.93,
,,,"of three several deaths; first, an intolerable",3.5.94,
,,,"fright, to be detected with a jealous rotten",3.5.95,
,,,"bell-wether; next, to be compassed, like a good",3.5.96,
,,,"bilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to",3.5.97,
,,,"point, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in,",3.5.98,
,,,"like a strong distillation, with stinking clothes",3.5.99,
,,,"that fretted in their own grease: think of that,--a",3.5.100,
,,,"man of my kidney,--think of that,--that am as subject",3.5.101,

,,,and thaw: it was a miracle to scape suffocation.,3.5.103,
,,,"And in the height of this bath, when I was more than",3.5.104,
,,,"half stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be",3.5.105,
,,,"thrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing hot,",3.5.106,
