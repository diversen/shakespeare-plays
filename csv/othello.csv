ACT I,,,,
SCENE I. Venice. A street.,,,,
,,,,Enter RODERIGO and IAGO
,RODERIGO,,,
,,Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly,1.1.1,
,,"That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse",1.1.2,
,,"As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.",1.1.3,
,IAGO,,,
,,"'Sblood, but you will not hear me:",1.1.4,
,,"If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.",1.1.5,
,RODERIGO,,,
,,Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.,1.1.6,
,IAGO,,,
,,"Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,",1.1.7,
,,"In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,",1.1.8,
,,"Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,",1.1.9,
,,"I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:",1.1.10,
,,"But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,",1.1.11,
,,"Evades them, with a bombast circumstance",1.1.12,
,,Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;,1.1.13,
,,"And, in conclusion,",1.1.14,
,,"Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,",1.1.15,
,,'I have already chose my officer.',1.1.16,
,,And what was he?,1.1.17,
,,"Forsooth, a great arithmetician,",1.1.18,
,,"One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,",1.1.19,
,,A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;,1.1.20,
,,"That never set a squadron in the field,",1.1.21,
,,Nor the division of a battle knows,1.1.22,
,,"More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,",1.1.23,
,,Wherein the toged consuls can propose,1.1.24,
,,"As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,",1.1.25,
,,"Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:",1.1.26,
,,"And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof",1.1.27,
,,"At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds",1.1.28,
,,"Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd",1.1.29,
,,"By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,",1.1.30,
,,"He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,",1.1.31,
,,And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.,1.1.32,
,RODERIGO,,,
,,"By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.",1.1.33,
,IAGO,,,
,,"Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,",1.1.34,
,,"Preferment goes by letter and affection,",1.1.35,
,,"And not by old gradation, where each second",1.1.36,
,,"Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,",1.1.37,
,,Whether I in any just term am affined,1.1.38,
,,To love the Moor.,1.1.39,
,RODERIGO,,,
,,I would not follow him then.,1.1.40,
,IAGO,,,
,,"O, sir, content you;",1.1.41,
,,I follow him to serve my turn upon him:,1.1.42,
,,"We cannot all be masters, nor all masters",1.1.43,
,,Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark,1.1.44,
,,"Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,",1.1.45,
,,"That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,",1.1.46,
,,"Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,",1.1.47,
,,"For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:",1.1.48,
,,Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are,1.1.49,
,,"Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,",1.1.50,
,,"Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,",1.1.51,
,,"And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,",1.1.52,
,,Do well thrive by them and when they have lined,1.1.53,
,,their coats,1.1.54,
,,Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;,1.1.55,
,,"And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,",1.1.56,
,,"It is as sure as you are Roderigo,",1.1.57,
,,"Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:",1.1.58,
,,"In following him, I follow but myself;",1.1.59,
,,"Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,",1.1.60,
,,"But seeming so, for my peculiar end:",1.1.61,
,,For when my outward action doth demonstrate,1.1.62,
,,The native act and figure of my heart,1.1.63,
,,"In compliment extern, 'tis not long after",1.1.64,
,,But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve,1.1.65,
,,For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.,1.1.66,
,RODERIGO,,,
,,What a full fortune does the thicklips owe,1.1.67,
,,If he can carry't thus!,1.1.68,
,IAGO,,,
,,"Call up her father,",1.1.69,
,,"Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,",1.1.70,
,,"Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,",1.1.71,
,,"And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,",1.1.72,
,,"Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,",1.1.73,
,,"Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,",1.1.74,
,,As it may lose some colour.,1.1.75,
,RODERIGO,,,
,,Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.,1.1.76,
,IAGO,,,
,,"Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell",1.1.77,
,,"As when, by night and negligence, the fire",1.1.78,
,,Is spied in populous cities.,1.1.79,
,RODERIGO,,,
,,"What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!",1.1.80,
,IAGO,,,
,,"Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!",1.1.81,
,,"Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!",1.1.82,
,,Thieves! thieves!,1.1.83,
,,,,"BRABANTIO appears above, at a window"
,BRABANTIO,,,
,,What is the reason of this terrible summons?,1.1.84,
,,What is the matter there?,1.1.85,
,RODERIGO,,,
,,"Signior, is all your family within?",1.1.86,
,IAGO,,,
,,Are your doors lock'd?,1.1.87,
,BRABANTIO,,,
,,"Why, wherefore ask you this?",1.1.88,
,IAGO,,,
,,"'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on",1.1.89,
,,your gown;,1.1.90,
,,"Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;",1.1.91,
,,"Even now, now, very now, an old black ram",1.1.92,
,,"Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise;",1.1.93,
,,"Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,",1.1.94,
,,Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:,1.1.95,
,,"Arise, I say.",1.1.96,
,BRABANTIO,,,
,,"What, have you lost your wits?",1.1.97,
,RODERIGO,,,
,,"Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?",1.1.98,
,BRABANTIO,,,
,,Not I	what are you?,1.1.99,
,RODERIGO,,,
,,My name is Roderigo.,1.1.100,
,BRABANTIO,,,
,,The worser welcome:,1.1.101,
,,I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:,1.1.102,
,,In honest plainness thou hast heard me say,1.1.103,
,,"My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,",1.1.104,
,,"Being full of supper and distempering draughts,",1.1.105,
,,"Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come",1.1.106,
,,To start my quiet.,1.1.107,
,RODERIGO,,,
,,"Sir, sir, sir,--",1.1.108,
,BRABANTIO,,,
,,But thou must needs be sure,1.1.109,
,,My spirit and my place have in them power,1.1.110,
,,To make this bitter to thee.,1.1.111,
,RODERIGO,,,
,,"Patience, good sir.",1.1.112,
,BRABANTIO,,,
,,What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;,1.1.113,
,,My house is not a grange.,1.1.114,
,RODERIGO,,,
,,"Most grave Brabantio,",1.1.115,
,,In simple and pure soul I come to you.,1.1.116,
,IAGO,,,
,,"'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not",1.1.117,
,,"serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to",1.1.118,
,,"do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll",1.1.119,
,,have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;,1.1.120,
,,you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have,1.1.121,
,,coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.,1.1.122,
,BRABANTIO,,,

,,It is too true an evil: gone she is;,1.1.171,
,,And what's to come of my despised time,1.1.172,
