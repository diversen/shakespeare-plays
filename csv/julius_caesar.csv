,SCENE I. Rome. A street.,,,,
,,,,,"Enter FLAVIUS, MARULLUS, and certain Commoners"
,,FLAVIUS,,,
,,,"Hence! home, you idle creatures get you home:",1.1.1,
,,,"Is this a holiday? what! know you not,",1.1.2,
,,,"Being mechanical, you ought not walk",1.1.3,
,,,Upon a labouring day without the sign,1.1.4,
,,,"Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?",1.1.5,
,,First Commoner,,,
,,,"Why, sir, a carpenter.",1.1.6,
,,MARULLUS,,,
,,,Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?,1.1.7,
,,,What dost thou with thy best apparel on?,1.1.8,
,,,"You, sir, what trade are you?",1.1.9,
,,Second Commoner,,,
,,,"Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but,",1.1.10,
,,,"as you would say, a cobbler.",1.1.11,
,,MARULLUS,,,
,,,But what trade art thou? answer me directly.,1.1.12,
,,Second Commoner,,,
,,,"A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe",1.1.13,
,,,"conscience; which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.",1.1.14,
,,MARULLUS,,,
,,,"What trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what trade?",1.1.15,
,,Second Commoner,,,
,,,"Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me: yet,",1.1.16,
,,,"if you be out, sir, I can mend you.",1.1.17,
,,MARULLUS,,,
,,,"What meanest thou by that? mend me, thou saucy fellow!",1.1.18,
,,Second Commoner,,,
,,,"Why, sir, cobble you.",1.1.19,
,,FLAVIUS,,,
,,,"Thou art a cobbler, art thou?",1.1.20,
,,Second Commoner,,,
,,,"Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl: I",1.1.21,
,,,"meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's",1.1.22,
,,,"matters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon",1.1.23,
,,,"to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I",1.1.24,
,,,recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon,1.1.25,
,,,neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.,1.1.26,
,,FLAVIUS,,,
,,,But wherefore art not in thy shop today?,1.1.27,
,,,Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?,1.1.28,
,,Second Commoner,,,
,,,"Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself",1.1.29,
,,,"into more work. But, indeed, sir, we make holiday,",1.1.30,
,,,to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.,1.1.31,
,,MARULLUS,,,
,,,Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?,1.1.32,
,,,"What tributaries follow him to Rome,",1.1.33,
,,,To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?,1.1.34,
,,,"You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!",1.1.35,
,,,"O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,",1.1.36,
,,,Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft,1.1.37,
,,,"Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,",1.1.38,
,,,"To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,",1.1.39,
,,,"Your infants in your arms, and there have sat",1.1.40,
,,,"The livelong day, with patient expectation,",1.1.41,
,,,To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:,1.1.42,
,,,"And when you saw his chariot but appear,",1.1.43,
,,,"Have you not made an universal shout,",1.1.44,
,,,"That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,",1.1.45,
,,,To hear the replication of your sounds,1.1.46,
,,,Made in her concave shores?,1.1.47,
,,,And do you now put on your best attire?,1.1.48,
,,,And do you now cull out a holiday?,1.1.49,
,,,And do you now strew flowers in his way,1.1.50,
,,,That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!,1.1.51,
,,,"Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,",1.1.52,
,,,Pray to the gods to intermit the plague,1.1.53,
,,,That needs must light on this ingratitude.,1.1.54,
,,FLAVIUS,,,
,,,"Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,",1.1.55,
,,,Assemble all the poor men of your sort;,1.1.56,
,,,"Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears",1.1.57,
,,,"Into the channel, till the lowest stream",1.1.58,
,,,Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.,1.1.59,
,,,,,Exeunt all the Commoners
,,,See whether their basest metal be not moved;,1.1.60,
,,,They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.,1.1.61,
,,,Go you down that way towards the Capitol;,1.1.62,
,,This way will I,,,
,,,"disrobe the images,",1.1.63,
,,,If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.,1.1.64,
,,MARULLUS,,,
,,,May we do so?,1.1.65,
,,,You know it is the feast of Lupercal.,1.1.66,
,,FLAVIUS,,,
,,,It is no matter; let no images,1.1.67,
,,,"Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about,",1.1.68,
,,,And drive away the vulgar from the streets:,1.1.69,
,,,"So do you too, where you perceive them thick.",1.1.70,
,,,These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing,1.1.71,
,,,"Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,",1.1.72,
,,,Who else would soar above the view of men,1.1.73,
,,,And keep us all in servile fearfulness.,1.1.74,
,,,,,Exeunt
,SCENE II. A public place.,,,,
,,,,,"Flourish. Enter CAESAR; ANTONY, for the course;  CALPURNIA, PORTIA, DECIUS BRUTUS, CICERO, BRUTUS,  CASSIUS, and CASCA; a great crowd following, among them a Soothsayer"

,,ANTONY,,,
,,,"Caesar, my lord?",1.2.7,
,,CAESAR,,,
,,,"Forget not, in your speed, Antonius,",1.2.8,
,,,"To touch Calpurnia; for our elders say,",1.2.9,
,,,"The barren, touched in this holy chase,",1.2.10,
,,,Shake off their sterile curse.,1.2.11,
,,ANTONY,,,
,,,I shall remember:,1.2.12,
,,,"When Caesar says 'do this,' it is perform'd.",1.2.13,

,,,Caesar!,1.2.15,
,,CAESAR,,,
,,,Ha! who calls?,1.2.16,

,,,Bid every noise be still: peace yet again!,1.2.17,
,,CAESAR,,,
,,,Who is it in the press that calls on me?,1.2.18,
,,,"I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,",1.2.19,
,,,Cry 'Caesar!' Speak; Caesar is turn'd to hear.,1.2.20,
,,Soothsayer,,,
,,,Beware the ides of March.,1.2.21,
,,CAESAR,,,
,,,What man is that?,1.2.22,
,,BRUTUS,,,
,,,A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.,1.2.23,
,,CAESAR,,,
,,,Set him before me; let me see his face.,1.2.24,
,,CASSIUS,,,
,,,"Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.",1.2.25,
,,CAESAR,,,
,,,What say'st thou to me now? speak once again.,1.2.26,
,,Soothsayer,,,
,,,Beware the ides of March.,1.2.27,
,,CAESAR,,,
,,,He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.,1.2.28,
,,,,,Sennet. Exeunt all except BRUTUS and CASSIUS
,,CASSIUS,,,
,,,Will you go see the order of the course?,1.2.29,
,,BRUTUS,,,
,,,Not I.,1.2.30,
,,CASSIUS,,,
,,,"I pray you, do.",1.2.31,
,,BRUTUS,,,
,,,I am not gamesome: I do lack some part,1.2.32,
,,,Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.,1.2.33,
,,,"Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;",1.2.34,
,,,I'll leave you.,1.2.35,
,,CASSIUS,,,
,,,"Brutus, I do observe you now of late:",1.2.36,
,,,I have not from your eyes that gentleness,1.2.37,
,,,And show of love as I was wont to have:,1.2.38,
,,,You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand,1.2.39,
,,,Over your friend that loves you.,1.2.40,
,,BRUTUS,,,
,,,"Cassius,",1.2.41,
,,,"Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,",1.2.42,
,,,I turn the trouble of my countenance,1.2.43,
,,,Merely upon myself. Vexed I am,1.2.44,
,,,"Of late with passions of some difference,",1.2.45,
,,,"Conceptions only proper to myself,",1.2.46,
,,,Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;,1.2.47,
,,,But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--,1.2.48,
,,,"Among which number, Cassius, be you one--",1.2.49,
,,,"Nor construe any further my neglect,",1.2.50,
,,,"Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,",1.2.51,
,,,Forgets the shows of love to other men.,1.2.52,
,,CASSIUS,,,
,,,"Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;",1.2.53,
,,,By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried,1.2.54,
,,,"Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.",1.2.55,
,,,"Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?",1.2.56,
,,BRUTUS,,,
,,,"No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,",1.2.57,
,,,"But by reflection, by some other things.",1.2.58,
,,CASSIUS,,,
,,,'Tis just:,1.2.59,
,,,"And it is very much lamented, Brutus,",1.2.60,
,,,That you have no such mirrors as will turn,1.2.61,
,,,"Your hidden worthiness into your eye,",1.2.62,
,,,"That you might see your shadow. I have heard,",1.2.63,
,,,"Where many of the best respect in Rome,",1.2.64,
,,,"Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus",1.2.65,
,,,"And groaning underneath this age's yoke,",1.2.66,
,,,Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.,1.2.67,
,,BRUTUS,,,
,,,"Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,",1.2.68,
,,,That you would have me seek into myself,1.2.69,
,,,For that which is not in me?,1.2.70,
,,CASSIUS,,,
,,,"Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:",1.2.71,
,,,And since you know you cannot see yourself,1.2.72,
,,,"So well as by reflection, I, your glass,",1.2.73,
,,,Will modestly discover to yourself,1.2.74,
,,,That of yourself which you yet know not of.,1.2.75,
,,,"And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:",1.2.76,
,,,"Were I a common laugher, or did use",1.2.77,
,,,To stale with ordinary oaths my love,1.2.78,
,,,To every new protester; if you know,1.2.79,
,,,That I do fawn on men and hug them hard,1.2.80,
,,,"And after scandal them, or if you know",1.2.81,
,,,That I profess myself in banqueting,1.2.82,
,,,"To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.",1.2.83,
,,,,,"Flourish, and shout"
,,BRUTUS,,,
,,,"What means this shouting? I do fear, the people",1.2.84,
,,,Choose Caesar for their king.,1.2.85,
,,CASSIUS,,,
,,,"Ay, do you fear it?",1.2.86,
,,,Then must I think you would not have it so.,1.2.87,
,,BRUTUS,,,
,,,"I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.",1.2.88,
,,,But wherefore do you hold me here so long?,1.2.89,
,,,What is it that you would impart to me?,1.2.90,
,,,"If it be aught toward the general good,",1.2.91,
,,,"Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,",1.2.92,
,,,"And I will look on both indifferently,",1.2.93,
,,,For let the gods so speed me as I love,1.2.94,
,,,The name of honour more than I fear death.,1.2.95,
,,CASSIUS,,,
,,,"I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,",1.2.96,
,,,As well as I do know your outward favour.,1.2.97,
,,,"Well, honour is the subject of my story.",1.2.98,
,,,I cannot tell what you and other men,1.2.99,
,,,"Think of this life; but, for my single self,",1.2.100,
,,,I had as lief not be as live to be,1.2.101,
,,,In awe of such a thing as I myself.,1.2.102,
,,,I was born free as Caesar; so were you:,1.2.103,
,,,"We both have fed as well, and we can both",1.2.104,
,,,Endure the winter's cold as well as he:,1.2.105,
,,,"For once, upon a raw and gusty day,",1.2.106,
,,,"The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,",1.2.107,
,,,"Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now",1.2.108,
,,,"Leap in with me into this angry flood,",1.2.109,
,,,"And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,",1.2.110,
,,,"Accoutred as I was, I plunged in",1.2.111,
,,,And bade him follow; so indeed he did.,1.2.112,
,,,"The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it",1.2.113,
,,,"With lusty sinews, throwing it aside",1.2.114,
,,,And stemming it with hearts of controversy;,1.2.115,
,,,"But ere we could arrive the point proposed,",1.2.116,
,,,"Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'",1.2.117,
,,,"I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,",1.2.118,
,,,Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder,1.2.119,
,,,"The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber",1.2.120,
,,,Did I the tired Caesar. And this man,1.2.121,
,,,"Is now become a god, and Cassius is",1.2.122,
,,,"A wretched creature and must bend his body,",1.2.123,
,,,If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.,1.2.124,
,,,"He had a fever when he was in Spain,",1.2.125,
,,,"And when the fit was on him, I did mark",1.2.126,
,,,"How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;",1.2.127,
,,,"His coward lips did from their colour fly,",1.2.128,
,,,And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world,1.2.129,
,,,Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:,1.2.130,
,,,"Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans",1.2.131,
,,,"Mark him and write his speeches in their books,",1.2.132,
,,,"Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'",1.2.133,
,,,"As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me",1.2.134,
,,,A man of such a feeble temper should,1.2.135,
,,,So get the start of the majestic world,1.2.136,
,,,And bear the palm alone.,1.2.137,
,,,,,Shout. Flourish
,,BRUTUS,,,
,,,Another general shout!,1.2.138,
,,,I do believe that these applauses are,1.2.139,
,,,For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.,1.2.140,
,,CASSIUS,,,
,,,"Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world",1.2.141,
,,,"Like a Colossus, and we petty men",1.2.142,
,,,Walk under his huge legs and peep about,1.2.143,
,,,To find ourselves dishonourable graves.,1.2.144,
,,,Men at some time are masters of their fates:,1.2.145,
,,,"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,",1.2.146,
,,,"But in ourselves, that we are underlings.",1.2.147,
,,,Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?,1.2.148,
,,,Why should that name be sounded more than yours?,1.2.149,
,,,"Write them together, yours is as fair a name;",1.2.150,
,,,"Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;",1.2.151,
,,,"Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,",1.2.152,
,,,Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.,1.2.153,
,,,"Now, in the names of all the gods at once,",1.2.154,
,,,"Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,",1.2.155,
,,,"That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!",1.2.156,
,,,"Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!",1.2.157,
,,,"When went there by an age, since the great flood,",1.2.158,
,,,But it was famed with more than with one man?,1.2.159,
,,,"When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,",1.2.160,
,,,That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?,1.2.161,
,,,"Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,",1.2.162,
,,,When there is in it but one only man.,1.2.163,
,,,"O, you and I have heard our fathers say,",1.2.164,
,,,There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd,1.2.165,
,,,The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome,1.2.166,
,,,As easily as a king.,1.2.167,
,,BRUTUS,,,
,,,"That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;",1.2.168,

,,,"I shall recount hereafter; for this present,",1.2.171,
,,,"I would not, so with love I might entreat you,",1.2.172,
,,,Be any further moved. What you have said,1.2.173,
,,,I will consider; what you have to say,1.2.174,

,,,Both meet to hear and answer such high things.,1.2.176,
,,,"Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:",1.2.177,
,,,Brutus had rather be a villager,1.2.178,
,,,Than to repute himself a son of Rome,1.2.179,
,,,Under these hard conditions as this time,1.2.180,
,,,Is like to lay upon us.,1.2.181,
,,CASSIUS,,,
,,,I am glad that my weak words,1.2.182,

,,BRUTUS,,,
,,,"I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,",1.2.188,
,,,"The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,",1.2.189,
,,,And all the rest look like a chidden train:,1.2.190,
,,,Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero,1.2.191,

,,,I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.,1.2.225,
,,CASCA,,,
,,,"Why, there was a crown offered him: and being",1.2.226,
,,,"offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,",1.2.227,
,,,thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.,1.2.228,
,,BRUTUS,,,
,,,What was the second noise for?,1.2.229,
,,CASCA,,,
,,,"Why, for that too.",1.2.230,

,,,"Why, for that too.",1.2.232,
,,BRUTUS,,,
,,,Was the crown offered him thrice?,1.2.233,
,,CASCA,,,
,,,"Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every",1.2.234,

,,CASSIUS,,,
,,,Who offered him the crown?,1.2.237,
,,CASCA,,,

,,,"Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.",1.2.239,
,,CASCA,,,
,,,I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:,1.2.240,
,,,it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark,1.2.241,
,,,Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown,1.2.242,
,,,"neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told",1.2.243,
,,,"you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my",1.2.244,
,,,"thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he",1.2.245,
,,,offered it to him again; then he put it by again:,1.2.246,
,,,"but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his",1.2.247,
,,,fingers off it. And then he offered it the third,1.2.248,
,,,time; he put it the third time by: and still as he,1.2.249,
,,,"refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their",1.2.250,
,,,chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps,1.2.251,
,,,and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because,1.2.252,
,,,Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked,1.2.253,
,,,Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and,1.2.254,
,,,"for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of",1.2.255,
,,,opening my lips and receiving the bad air.,1.2.256,
,,CASSIUS,,,
,,,"But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?",1.2.257,
,,CASCA,,,
,,,"He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at",1.2.258,
,,,"mouth, and was speechless.",1.2.259,
,,BRUTUS,,,
,,,'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.,1.2.260,
